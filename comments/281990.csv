281990,TWAG,"1,735","1,818","1,138",True,249.7,May 10,"Edit: As of writing this review, I have 20 hours logged in Stellaris.  Stellaris has been out for 29 hours.
This is the story of those 20 hours.
My friends and I all arranged to play stellaris together on release.  I didn't know what to play until I remembered that happiness is a core game mechanic - unhappy people rebel, happy people don't.  I don't want rebellions, those make people even more unhappy.  If I took ""Spiritualist,"" I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness.  Even better, if I grabbed ""Fanatic Spiritualist"" I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions ever.
It wasn't deep enough.
I found the communal trait, which adds +5% happiness, and the charismatic trait, which gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planet.
I had to go deeper
I found out that by balancing my racial attributes, national ethics, and even my form of government, I was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness.  I ended up as a fanatically spiritual, pacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone.  To top it off, I found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alien, the kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about ""Alien abductions.""  Classic grays, but with a big, doofy grin slapped permanently across their faces.
My friends all started on the opposite side of the galaxy from me, so I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI.  It didn't matter what I did, my people remained happy.  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain.  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movement, distributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld.  I shipped them across my empire, balancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of world, after all.  
And we were all so, so happy.
But we needed more friends.
So I found some primitives, who hadn't achieved spaceflight yet.  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them.  Then, of course, I began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic community.
I then genetically modified the boars to be just as happy as we are.  This is where this game is, now:  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxy, making and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxy, where I've spent my time well:  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happy, just like us.
Thanks to this game, I have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals week.
And I have no regrets.
Update from 5/11:
I managed to explore around an unexplored chunk of the outer rim, finding several of my friends.  Meanwhile, I enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit.  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of them, as the other was naturally happy.
My alliance with the angry fungus was expanded with the addition of my super-xenophile cat-neighbors.  Fully 1/3 of the galaxy's cat-people population quickly migrated to my planets and set out being so productive and so happy as a result of being surrounded by my people that engineering them would actually be a waste of resources.
The Alien loving cats, the angry fungus, and I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and ""liberating"" all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethics.
The entire time my friends were wailing, moaning, and there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies until, after 15 years of war, they managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peace.
My friend Joe wasn't so lucky and couldn't secure an alliance with the rest of my friends on their side of the galaxy before the same non-player empire declared war on Joe, took one planet, liberated another under its own new government, and vassalized him.
That's when we saved and quit until next time:
In summary:
I'm slowly increasing in power and enlightening more races into blissful happiness as my friends are at constantly at war and Joe is getting vassalized by non-player empires.			"

281990,pohlse,792,869,76,True,329.1,May 28,"185+ Hours and 3 full campaigns in and I finally feels like I can review Stellaris objectively.
Stellaris is a 4x grand strategy game from Paradox. So I kind of expected a Civilization in space kind of game (Like Galactic Civilization 3) which isn't a bad thing since I love 4x games. But what I got was something different; a 4x, grand strategy, customizable, nearly open-ended RPG. And that is where this game sets itself apart from all others in the 4x field.
Campaign 1 – Since everything was new I tried to chose things familiar; Humans, warp drive, materialist, individualist, etc... While I found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics I was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation. Eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power. With the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighbors, over-throw a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders. More than once I found myself wishing for more victory conditions, and when I started feeling like it was getting a little stale I pumped out a crap-ton of colony ships to meet the domination victory condition (owning 40% of habitable planets). All in all a good run.
Campaign 2 – Within 5 years I had encountered a Fallen Empire and they hated me from the beginning, instantly declaring war, which I immediately had to surrender. A couple of years later I met ANOTHER Fallen Empire and THEY hated me. I was playing peaceful, scientist, cat people... Maybe everyone was allergic because everyone, even regular empires, kept insulting me, threatening me, and declaring war on me until I was finally curb-stomped into a chunky red paste. What did I learn from my violent and abusive loss? Better influence and sector management techniques. 
Campaign 3 – Military Dictatorship using wormhole generators to move. What a difference a little experience makes! Never once during this campaign did I find myself struggling with the influence mechanic and working with the oddities of the sector mechanic have become rather easy. Fallen empires treat me as a child in need of patience, enemies avoided my vast fleets and my economic power was unmatched. When one of my rivals triggered a galactic wide robot uprising, all I needed to do was put all my robot populations to death and outlaw AI. Easy peasy! Later when I stumbled across the robot capital world I invaded with a genetically engineered xeno army, killed all the robots, and had  a beautiful Gaia world all to myself. Of course I had no friends, allies, trading partners, or anything else. Sadly, I started getting a little bored so I again jumped to a domination victory.
Currently Stellaris is the tale of three games:
Early game – Brilliantly fun and engaging! Lots of events that change depending on your pre-game choices, lots of 4x fun, and lots of role playing make the early game really enjoyable and re-playable.
Mid game – Lots of repetitive management is required with not a lot of new game content occurring. Being a warmonger can certainly spice this part up but that may not be everyone's cup of tea.  
Late game – Some very interesting galaxy wide events/disasters occur and the rise and fall of some of your neighbors keeps some interest. However, the lack of more victory conditions does make things drag a bit.
Overall I love, LOVE, this game. Does it need more victory conditions? Yes. Does it need more mid game events? Yes. Does it need better tool tips? Yes. Are wormhole generators the greatest thing ever? Yes!
One final thing to keep in mind is that the Clarke patch is about to release which will fix a lot of the sector issues and questionable AI decisions. And the future Asimov patch will address the mid game issues. Which means that things are going to keep getting better so I highly recommend this game to everyone.
Edited to Add:
Wow! The Clarke patch hit and what a change!
Midway through my fourth campaign and suddenly, after load, the sectors started actually producing, science costs reduced slightly, fighter and bomber groups became wildly effective, federation partners began fighting their own battles (a bit), other empires asked for (and offered) safe passage through their space, diplomatic requests began to pour in, enemy AI combat decisions became much smarter, and all the frontier outposts I had been hiding in sectors to avoid influence costs grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, bent me over a log, and yelled “squeal like a pig!”
What a massive improvement!
The future Asimov patch is still needed for mid game content, but if you were waiting to buy Stellaris, well wait no more. It is even better now.			"

281990,MethTurtle,522,576,34,True,79.7,May 15,"Written at just under 40 hours gameplay time.
THE GOOD:I. - Customization of everything. First you start out with making your species, picking its homeworld type, leader, emblem, traits and more. You can also rename anything you want while you play. I literally have not found something I could not rename. Leaders, planets, stars, sectors, ships, etc. I especially like that there are 3 types of Space Travel: Warp Drive, Hyperdrive, Wormhole Stations. Each one works a little differently, and has its own advantages and disadvantages.
II. - Vastness. Unfortunately for me, I run Stellaris on a potato, so I am limited to the smaller size (150 stars). You can have up to 1000 stars on the largest map size.
As of patch 1.0.3, I can now run the game (mostly) fine w/ larger map sizes.
III. - Variety of systems. It’s got it all, black holes, pulsars, you name it. All sorts of interesting solar systems are randomly generated.
IV. - Pops. I love the Pops mechanics. Every pop has traits, but they can diverge into different traits and ethics over time. Later on when I unlocked gene modification, my own people started modifying themselves and changing. I also uplifted some plant-people, then genetically modified them some more to make them a biogenic army invasion force to use against my enemies. (+40% dmg is pretty nice).
V. - Fallen Empires. I tried to go to war with one of them. That was a very bad idea. I look forward being able to take on one of these guys at some point.
THE ""HUH?"":
I. - Some very strange UI choices in places.It’s true, the UI is phenomenal compared to other Paradox games, but some strange things still lurk about. Quickly finding a list of all your trade deals isn’t exactly obvious. Another example would be edicts. All planets have them, but there’s also empire-wide edicts on an entirely different tab. 
II. - No Map Modes.In my first game I formed a Federation, half expecting a great merging color of myself and friends, showing our new Federation name. Nope. No map modes of any kind. (Allies, enemies, Alliances/Federations, economy. etc)
III. - I didn’t notice I was being invaded. Not until they were already bombarding one of my homeworlds and had blown up a space station did I notice. You only receive a small notification at the top when they enter your space… which will always be there if you’re within THEIR territory at the same time. This bothers me a lot.
IV. - Food. Another bizarre one. Every planet has food production in addition to its energy, science and minerals. Yet, if I have a planet producing 11 extra food, and the pops are all filled, then what should I do with it? Well, don’t worry about that because you can’t do anything with it. Cant trade it, transport to your other worlds, sell it, nothing. Having extra food doesn’t seem to do anything beneficial whatsoever.
THE BAD:I. - The AI. I don’t even know where to start on the AI. It’s dumb. Really dumb. Even on hard the AI doesn’t do a anything that I have seen. The most interesting thing the AI has ever done in my games is go to war with their neighbor. Once. Nothing came of it. Another time three empires created an alliance.
II. - The AI Really does suck.
III. - Sectors. Once your star empire begins growing for real, you’re going to have a ton of planets to keep track of. Thus we have Sectors, zones you designate by star system. It makes sense, and it essentially automates those planets for you. The UI for sectors is far from good, and needs many changes to be useful, but that doesn’t bother me nearly as much as the total inability for Sectors to automatically build Spaceports, Ships or Armies. This is downright infuriating, because you have to open the absolutely abysmal sector list, open each one, then click each individual sub planet within that sector and build a spaceport. This. Is. AWFUL. 
IV. - Trade/Diplomacy. Everything is wrong with this. I first noticed when I formed my first Federation. After managing to make friends by essentially giving away minerals and credits and repeatedly renewing research/star chart exchanges, we formed an alliance. This was very tedious even then, but I figured the real cool stuff would happen at Federation level. Boy was I wrong. Once I formed my federation…. Well that’s it. Nothing changed as opposed to an alliance. I figured some type of Voting system would be involved to vote on federation laws, kick members out, set Federation-wide Policies (Prohibiting slavery seems like a thing a Federation  made up of very different alien species would vote on, right?). This was a massive disappointment, there is absolutely nothing special about being in a federation. Except the Federation Fleet. You can build ships with all Federation Members pooled Tech, so they're the best ships you can make. Only the Federation President can make them, so you lose control after you lose your seat (alternates every 10 yrs between members). 
So after waiting 30 years to regain my presidency, I am excited to see the size of the fleet.... THE STUPID AI DIDNT BUILD ANY. AT ALL. ZERO. IN THIRTY YEARS. NOT ONE SINGLE SHIP.
The Diplomacy Menu itself is another massive disappointment. It’s fairly simple, a list of trade deals you can do, but it’s missing such basic things… like the ability to see how many minerals/credits they have. If you try to trade 1000 credits for 1000 minerals or vice versa, and they only have 990, the trade deal wont go through. But it won’t ever say it didn’t go through. And they could have as little as 5 credits/minerals. You have no way of knowing! Additionally, where the hell is the button to trade food? Oh yeah, I forgot, food is totally meaningless in a huge, populated galaxy!
 Lastly, and probably the worst out of everything… War is too easy. This may relate to the amazingly dumb AI, but every game I’ve played has been the same… expand first and fast, and then conquer my nearest neighbor and vassalize them. Now I have double the fleet because once I declare war on a second empire, my new vassal’s fleet attaches and follows mine. This immediately starts a huge snowball effect and my giant deathblob of ships just move on and on until everyone around me is my personal ♥♥♥♥♥. It shouldn’t be this easy. You know what would be great? If the AI empires around me, after I conquered Vassal number 2 or 3, pulled their heads out of their asses and said “Oh man. Let’s make an alliance and stop this crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ before he comes for us.” 
V. - Endless Stability. For a Paradox game, I am just stunned by how there’s no infighting whatsoever. There are factions, but they don’t do anything. Rebellions are supposed to be a huge feature. If you’ve ever played CK2 you know how frustrating it is to be going through 20 years of civil war just because your King died while hunting, and his 4 sons decide to tear apart the Kingdom for the Throne. So where the hell is this kind of thing for Stellaris? Disabled, apparently. That’s right. They released the game without one of their most well-known mechanics. One day they say there will be a patch to enable rebellions and factions once again, but how they released it without it already working is just beyond me.
Stellaris is a very fun game. I enjoy it a lot. But there are some glaring problems (AI, trade/diplo, UI) that ANYONE at Paradox should have seen. In my opinion, they have essentially released a Beta. A very fun beta, but it clearly is not finished. I expect a stupid amount of DLC for this game, as their past titles had as well. However, if they expect me to pay for a DLC pack just so there is some kind of REAL DIPLOMACY/TRADE, they can ♥♥♥♥ off. This is something that should be in the base game. Period.			"
281990,KnightErrantJG,469,522,329,True,39.2,May 12,"I could write a review for Stellaris and go into a great deal of depth about its gameplay and aesthetics, but I'm not going to. Instead, I'm going to tell you the story of Admiral Cax.
The Tale of Admiral Cax, Hero of the Blessed Light of Toroba
Long before he was born, Cax's people, an atomic-age civilisation of reptilians called the Netraxi, had noticed something odd about their leaders. Sure, they seemed fine from afar but on closer inspection they were just a little bit too...mushroom-y. Still, they shrugged and kept on doing whatever nuclear-powered reptiles do. And then the day came when the disguises fell and the Netraxi were taken over by the fanatically religious empire of slave-taking mushrooms that had quietly infiltrated their society using some questionable shapeshifting magic. The Netraxi were aghast. They were enraged. And then they were enslaved.
These conniving chantarelles, known to their friends (not many) as the Blessed Light of Toroba and their enemies (quite a bit more) as the Doom Shrooms, were to be masters of the Netraxi for a hundred years. For this darkest of centuries, the Netraxi slaved away to supply their overlords with ambiguously-defined but evidently useful minerals, their labour rewarded only with contempt, and a reminder to worship the God-Emperor of Toroba at all times. The unhappiest Netraxi were sent down the mines. The happiest were released, allowed to be outraged about their situation for a bit, and then enslaved again just for fun. And when the Torobin went to war, the Netraxi were chained together and dropped as a welcome-mat for the Toroban armed forces to march over.
Those hundred years passed, and the Torobin began to see the Netraxi in a more enlightened way. It was decided that some - though not all - should be emancipated to test their loyalty to their God-Emperor. Surprisingly, they were indeed loyal. Within ten years, the remaining Netraxi had been freed, but this was only the beginning of the struggle for freedom, All across Torobin space, a dozen other races remained enslaved, and the blatantly racist policies of the Torobin meant that there was only room for Shroom in positions of power.
And then the great, glorious and eternally enlightened God-Emperor Zifin I (may his spores find warm soils!) decided that one - but only one - filthy xeno would be given the opportunity to lead Toroban forces. His case would decide whether or not aliens were worthy of being equals to those they had once called master. They chose a lowly Netraxi called Cax.
Cax was a badass.
Hired at the age of 41, he was immediately thrust into the Toroban war of conquest against an alliance led by the Bavi, a technologically superior race. Four fleets were deployed: three led by Torobin and the fourth led by Cax. Almost immediately the fleets were heavily engaged, taking severe casualties. Cax was sent to support a Toroban admiral, but when he warped in he found the Admiral's fleet destroyed, the gallant mushroom shredded and scattered across the system. Undaunted, Cax sent his fleet into the attack and smashed the Admiral's killers, securing the system. As the Torobin lost a second fleet to the Bavi, it was only Cax holding the line that gave the Torobin enough leverage to force a white peace and retreat with their dignity intact.
This was only the beginning.
Cax was sent back to Torobos to rebuild his fleet and upgrade it, in the expectation that the Torobin would soon be having a second go at the Bavi. Five years into the refit, however, he received the chilling news that a portal had opened up only a few systems away, spewing forth energy demons that wished only to feast upon the mortals' planets. The unlucky star-system was consumed. And then another system fell. And another. And another. And then it was Netraxis' turn. Cax could only look on via his monitor as his beloved homeworld, his people that looked to him for salvation, everyone, were all annihilated in a heartbeat. As the Torobin military crumbled he took his fleet to the furthest sector, the Malthin Bulwark, and gathered his forces for a desperate counterattack.
And then the Fox nation attacked.
Either through cold malice or a hilarious inability to perceive the danger of FRICKIN' WORLD-EATING ENERGY DEMONS, the race known only as the Sly Foxes decided to attack the Toroban Glorious Alliance with overwhelming force, right along the line of the Malthin Bulwark. Cax found his reinforcements cut off, his spaceports attacked and his empire still dined upon by the dreaded Unbidden. It was then, in this darkest of hours, that Cax made his move.
With the Bulwark crumbling behind him, Cax launched a desperate attack against the Unbidden Portal with every warship the Torobin could muster. It was do or die. If he won, the Unbidden would no longer be able to spam doomstacks to conquer the ungrateful galaxy. But if he lost...the galaxy would be lost with him. At the age of 54, with a hundred warships in tow, this would be his finest hour.
He did it.
He frickin' did it.
Surrounded by no fewer than three Unbidden doomstacks, Admiral Cax somehow fought his way to the portal and shattered the demons' grip on the galaxy, destroying two of the doomstacks as he did so. With his mission accomplished, he warped away to safety. Fewer than a third of his captains made it out. But the galaxy was saved. For any ordinary admiral, this would have been a time to celebrate. But Cax was no ordinary admiral.
Cax was a badass.
Badly damaged from the Battle for the Portal, Cax immediately returned his fleet to the Bulwark and smashed the Sly Foxes in a series of fleet-to-fleet battles, taking the war deep into the enemy's heartland. A little too deep, some might say, because there was the slight issue of his fleet being surrounded and utterly destroyed, but Cax made it out and his heroic counter-attack had once again turned a losing situation into a White Peace. By now Cax was pushing 70. Time to retire, the Torobin said.
But badassery doesn't retire.
Cax immediately took command of a new fleet being built to purge the galaxy of the Unbidden for once and for all. Armed with the latest weapons and cutting-edge technology taken from the Sly Foxes, Cax's Crusaders came together from all corners of Torobin space to follow their inspiring commander. The liberation was long and bittersweet, as although Cax was proud to be the Admiral chosen to drive the Unbidden from his homeworld, he knew that only the dead would greet him on Netraxis. But liberate he did, and at the age of 100 he destroyed the last Unbidden installation and restored the lost worlds to the Torobin. In gratitude, the God-Emperor transformed Toroba into a Mega-Corporation and emancipated every last slave, all thanks to Cax's heroism. And they all lived happily ever after, right?
Wrong.
Happily ever after is for people who haven't tried hard enough.
Cax had a score to settle with the Bavi. They had destroyed his companions in the Bavi War. They had stood back and watched as the Unbidden destroyed his homeworld. Worst of all, they were just kinda there, y'know?. And so, at the age of 108, Cax set out for one final war. The names and legends of that war still echo down the ages. At Zabeem it was Cax who ambushed the 12th Bavi Fleet and smashed it to scrap. At Gandaros it was Cax who rescued the allied fleets from certain doom. At Kovin it was Cax who held the line as fleet after fleet warped in and were suddenly, but unsurprisingly, vanquished. And it was behind Admiral Cax that the entire allied fleet mustered for the final assault on Hydrobius that ended the war. Best of all, the surviving Netraxi were given permission to colonise the new worlds opened up by the Second Bavi War. Cax hadn't just saved his people, he'd given them a future too.
When he died at 113, the mourning was brief and efficient. He would've liked it that way. RIP Cax.			"

You’ll soon meet some other races, and realize your destiny to is befriend/ trade with / ignore/ exploit/ exterminate these new creatures. As you expand through use of colonies and strategically placed flags (also called frontier outposts by the humorless), you will work towards your goals for (insert goals here). This expansion will not go unnoticed, and you’re sure to make enemies and friends among the other races you’ve encountered, whose visual appearance has almost no bearing on their preferred world. (Personally my closest ally is a bunch of Sea-warthogs, and I’m also trading partners with a race of desert penguins)
Combat is interesting. The number below your fleet tells you an idea of it’s strength, but not the whole story. You’d be tempted to think like CK2 or EU, where if you have the larger force and a good general you’re generally come out on top. But that’s not the case here. Just ask the 1st fleet of the United Nations of Earth. Armed to the teeth with anti-matter missiles, and assisted by several dozen ships of our fungi allies, up against a force less than 70% of their size.
You actually can’t ask them. They’re all pretty dead. Point defenses turned out to be pretty good at point defense. So remember to not put all your eggs in one basket. Or Spores in one pouch, as the fungi say. Some missiles, some laser, spread the wealth.
Diplomacy is fairly straight forward. You get along better with races that have similar morals to your own, and especially xenophiles in general, but through enough effort you can even getting along with xenophobes. (Those desert penguins mentioned above are kind of racists, but we get along alright). Embassies are a big help. Alliances can be pretty easily formed with those you get along with, and are a great way to both protect yourself and to make offensive wars easier. When declaring war as part of an alliance everyone has to approve it. This is made easier by distributing the war goals amongst the members. Basically a planet to the sea hogs, a liberation to the fungi, etc. Thankfully defensive wars are automatic. You can’t leave them hanging.
The science and tech tree is a bit different from most because it’s not really a tree. It’s a set of cards you draw that you ‘draw’ three from and then decide which to work on. But my favorite part is definitely the science ships. You’re essentially playing as the Enterprise, boldly going where no one has gone before(star trek theme plays here). You’ll run into all sorts of anomalies that require investigation. Sometimes it’s a whole story line about precursors, sometimes it’s just an old cruiser stuck on a planet. Sometimes you run into a system full of million year old mining drones and have to book it. It keeps things interesting. 
The random events are very much what we’ve come to expect from paradox. A perfect mix of good writing and humor. Even the ol’ comet event comes around in it’s orbit.
TLDR: It’s a really interesting take on 4x that is everything you should expect from Paradox, and sure to get better with time, and DLCs. A little difficult to learn at first but better than their other games.
TLDR-2: Just play it.			"

281990,thestrifist,392,450,69,True,31.9,May 11,"To keep it simple-
Pros:
+ Brilliant early game, with twists, turns and several unique bits of writing and discovery. It becomes quickly apparent that a lot of love and dedication was put into this title.
+ Pacing. Never feels too fast/slow, except for endgame, which I shall be getting to.
+ GUI is simple, uncluttered and thematically amazing, rare in strategy games nowadays.
+ Beautiful OST.
+ Choice of traits and governments is pretty damn fun - especially when playing Space Hitler/Space Jesus.
+ MOD SUPPORT 11/10.
+ Just buy it, man.
Cons:
- While I have been fanboying over this title for a while and have absolutely fallen in love with it, there's no denying that the pace of your gameplay will slow down towards the late stages, which is expected. I trust mods and Paradox to fix this issue quickly though.
- You will never know sleep ever again.
Just to show you how addicting this is, I happened to purchase Dark Souls III at the exact same time as I preordered this - between watching Let's Plays and playing the game itself, I haven't even started my installation of DS3 yet. And I don't plan to either.			"

281990,76561198079539231,"1,205","1,474",38,False,44.2,May 12,"I went back and forth on whether to give Stellaris a thumbs up or down. I really like Paradox Games: I've played a lot of Crusader Kings 2, which I think is incredible, and I pre-ordered Stellaris wanting it to be really good. Knowing Paradox's history with CK2 and extensive DLC support, I think Stellaris in a couple year's time is going to be amazing. At present, with fanboy goggles off, I think IGN's review has it spot-on. The game has a lot of great ideas mixed up with weak execution. Considering the amount of hype and sales it's already got, I doubt my single bad review is going to tank this game, so I'm putting this here for the devs to hear some of the things that can be worked on. 
My experience: The AI was so passive and my empire was so stable in the mid-game, I literally just sat and built battleships for lack of anything to do, and then when the [redacted] came, my 160k death-stack pew-pewed them into oblivion. I then sat and let the game run, and I now have almost every single tech. I'm not sure what's left to do.  I've stopped my playthrough because...I don't really want to go through the chore of conquering every other empire and there isn't really anything else to do.
The biggest problems in my mind are two-fold and related: a lack of mid-game goals, and a lack of meaningful ways to interact with the world at large. 
Crusader Kings 2 was fantastic because it tied all its game mechanics together with people with deep traits and interactions you could interact with in multiple ways. It also kept empires from becoming stale because any CK2 player will tell you the biggest challenge with empires isn't conquering people, it's keeping everything together when your leader dies and every single up-start vassal wants to rebel. Stellaris doesn't really have this: leaders lack personality and pops don't have the same impact on gameplay. In all my time as a slaving Penguin Empire, I never saw a rebellion or significant unrest. This makes the mid and late game very static: you don't have reactive goals like 'Murder the upstart Duke of Lombardy' in CK2, and it's made worse by a simple, standard 4x diplomacy and war system, so you rarely feel compelled to interact with the empires around you. 
Additionally, Stellaris currently lacks tools to meaningfully solve problems. In CK2, dealing with eg, a useless heir was fun. Do I make him take religious orders? Marry him off to a foreign empire? Straight up murder him? Get him killed in a war? Stellaris comes close with some of the tools to interact with your alien pops, like slavery, gene modification, resettlement and edicts, but the way the game is set up right now alien populations aren't really a challenge: they don't rebel, or make significant demands for independence, or try to change your policies. So...you end up gene-modding them when you're bored, or when you lack things to do. Worse, and this is a big misstep, to deal with actual dissent the game just makes you pay some resources to make a 'Dissatisfaction' bar go down. Considering how well CK2 implemented rebellious vassals, this isn't really a good design decision. 
PROs:
- Great empire designer
- Engaging early-game, with exploration and anomalies
- Lots of room to be expanded on
- Genetically modify rebellious citizens 
- Meddle with primitive races
- End-game crises
CONs:
- War is really, really tedious
- Lack of interesting ways to interact with other empires
- No real threat of rebellion from leaders/alien pops
- Framerate drops at mid-game makes the game more of a slog
- Creating sectors isn't as fun as having vassals in CK2
EDIT: Welp, the Paradox devs have talked about how their mid-game content was cut last minute before release and they'll be adding it back at the end of June, plus bug fixes and changes to Sector AI so check back then with Stellaris if you're on the fence

To quote a friend:
It's like you met this girl on a dating site and you two seemed to hit it off really well. From her pictures she looked super fit and she seemed to carry herself off well. Not to mention you got to talk to her friends and they made you think she was great. When you decide to meet however, turns out she doesn't have money for the cab fare to get there so after some hesitation you decide to just pay for that.
She arrives. She looks pretty but she's shallow and extremely materialistic. You get the feeling she's not all there. She's fun to be with at first, but soon you realize two things. One, she seems to be just repeating what people have said before. Two, she's actually only 14-years-old. You were just completely bedazzled initially by her looks to notice.
So after an awkward first conta- meeting, you finally drop her back off at her place. You're feeling a bit regretful at the whole affair and kinda want your cab fare back (along with the other expenses she managed to accrue along the way). The door opens and 'lo and behold. Her dad is there. It's mother♥♥♥♥ing Crusader Kings II. He's shirtless, abs glistening with sweat like he just finished another exhilarating workout. Hair parted in that perfect way that accentuates his perfect face. his eyes brimming with the spark and wisdom of age. He smiles a bit at you, knowingly with a dash of smugness that comes across as just beautiful in every way. There are a few scars on his chest which mark the signs of his intense battle to get to where he is. His hand decorated with the blood of the heathen. His magnificent DEUS VULT under the towel that he greets you in, huge in size and bursting with... DLC.
You take another look at Stellaris. She eyes you coquettishly, though you can't help but remind yourself how young she is, especially when compared to her father.
You realize what she might be when she becomes an adult, her pedigree might take her far.
But for now, you toss Stellaris into the bushes and jump into the arms of Crusader Kings II.			"

281990,rathmourn,208,243,5,True,115.2,May 11,"Personally, this game is shaping up to be the perfect blend between Paradox's normal ""Grand Strategy Games"" and 4X Civilization types.  Being an intense Civilization fan, I've always found the games to lack a certain depth and scale to them.  Being a similarly intense fan of games like EU4 and CK2, I've always found they lacked the explore and developmental cycles found in Civilization games.  A yin and a yang if you will - which caused me to always only partially scratch the itch I wanted to scratch when I played either genre of the game.
To me, Stellaris fixes that.  Its combination of 4X aspects, along with the grand strategy level diplomacy, management and scale finally scratch that itch for me perfectly.  Yin and yang working in harmony.
Does the game have a few things that need tweaking? Absolutely.  The AI needs some adjusting to be a bit more involved and logical on its alliance and federation diplomacy, and the races traited towards dominance and war need to be a bit more blood thirsty and aggressive.  For what its worth, we're two days into release and Paradox has already patched minor issues and is listening to the community to address any further tweaks that may be needed.
Regardless, its absolutely worth your money if these types of games are for you.  Having been a customer of Paradox for years now, I am truly excited to how much further they can and will take this game.			"

281990,badratsforever,939,"1,250",31,False,42.6,May 14,"tl;dr: Stellaris in my opinion is a game that has potential but overall feels unfinished.
It's basically a union of the average 4X and the grand strategy Paradox are so good at. Let's go through it one feature at a time.
The early game is great. The exploration phase and finding anomalies is beyond promising, there's even questlines for that RPG feel. Most importantly though, it's fleshed out. Anomalies paint a picture that give the galaxy some depth, which is why the early game is so damn good. As for the questlines, they have potential but I have yet to finish one because of lack of border access once I get boxed in. Pirates appeared after I founded my first colony, with an event to come with it. They attacked my colony, I attacked them and destroyed their base, after that Pirates never bothered me ever again. Which was weird.
The transition to mid-game is nothing short of rough. Suddenly, there's nowhere left in the galaxy to explore because I'm boxed in between two empires that are much stronger than me. I also had to start handing control over to sectors, which is AI that manages colonies so I don't have to micromanage my empire when I have hundreds of them. Don't even get me started on the AI, but the main purpose of sectors is to give rebels who want independence a clear goal, which is to secede an entire sector. Though they can be easily paid off with some bribes. 
The tech tree is alright. It's extensive, I'll give it that. The idea is that every time you finish a tech, you have 3 options. Each time those 3 are semi-random, like drawing from a set of cards. It's a pretty good idea, but it makes it difficult to plan ahead when it's semi-random each time. You also get ""Rare"" technologies that aren't rare at all. I got an achievement for researching 10 rare techs in one game, being my first game. 
There isn't much to be said about pops or buildings. It's very much like Civilization V where you assign citizens to work certain tiles, but it's in space. Buildings enhance those tiles. But to get better buildings you have to improve your capital building, which requires a certain amount of pops to do so. This means small planets are essentially useless. Mining is straight-forward. You build mining stations or research stations wherever you can. As long as you can balance resources that is.
Of course, there is also Ethics. Ethics are what shapes your empire. Are you peaceful, or warlike? Are you a Xenophile, or a Xenophobe? Are you a Collectivist, or an Individualist? Again, it's a good idea, but it's not done properly. Ethics as a whole feels like it's more about what you can't do that what you can do. It limits the gameplay by letting very specific ethics do specific things. What's that, you found a level 4 anomaly giving you an extremely high tech ship? Oh wait, I'm a Xenophobe, trash it and get some influence (This actually happened to me). Despite being militeristic, I had only one option in that event. I didn't have a choice about what to do witht that ship, which was infuritating. So when you have one ability that requires one ethic, it leaves the rest out in the cold. And with diplomacy, every single empire you meet gives you the same set of responses based on your ethics, which don't mean anything as far as I know, but it's still repetitive. Which brings me to my next point. 
Now for the main problem with this game, interacting with other Empires. Everything about it feels unfinished. Midgame overall is a slog, and the barebone diplomacy and lack of internal politics definitely doesn't help. Empires can build alliances with each other. If you have at least 4 members of that alliance you can become what is known as a Federation. No, not Star Trek-style federation. It's just a glorified alliance that gives the leader more say and everyone else even less to do. Trade is almost non-existant. There's no trade routes, and the AI doesn't seem to understand how to accept or decline deals properly. 
Warfare is completely broken. At least with AI. You're supposed to fight like your average Space war. Fleets attack fleets, Orbital bombardment, invading planets, etc. But sadly it doesn't work. Enemy AI essentially chases you around which makes it easy to tie up a much larger fleet with a tiny one. Allied AI does the same thing. They follow your largest fleet with their entire force, even if it's twice the size of yours. And while the enemy might leave a few fleets lying around, the allied AI literally uses their entire fleet. Which means that I have to do everything. Broken warfare made me quit my first game, in fact. 
And at last we come to Late game. So the idea of the Late game is that as you research more and more advanced techs, they become riskier. This culminates in an End game crisis. For example, you can research techs that allow you to build robot pops. And as time goes on, technology allows these pops to become more and more efficient. Eventually though, as you'd expect, the robots become self aware and rebel once they become less of toasters (Stellaris AI) and more as advanced intelligence. 
Currently, there are 3 End game Crisis'. 
1. Robots. They're unstoppable. They outproduce and outresearch everyone. You may be able to fight off their initial revolt, but eventually they will defeat someone and take over their empire, and from there it's a death sentence. 
2. Extradimensional invaders known as the Unbidden. These appear if you research and use the Jump Drive, a late game tech. Sadly, it's broken because the Empires' AI don't seem to be aware of the threat and therefore don't unite against them. In fact, they don't fight back at all. The only way to defeat the Unbidden is by destroying the portal they came through.
3. And finally, Extragalactic invaders known as the Prethoryn Swarm. They appear when you do neither of the above. They're pretty much the same as the Unbidden, but instead of a portal, you have to capture their queen to defeat them. They infect planets with their infective...ness and have to be bombarded to cure. Again, the AI are too dumb to understand the threat the Prethoryn pose. And worse yet, the Prethroyn are also dumb, and don't do anything after the initial invasion of a single empire. This is the only one I've experienced so far, so the other two might be the same.
The End game crisis is a great idea, but again, it isn't executed properly. Which is a shame because it's really set apart from your average 4X in that respect. 
All that being said, there are two things that I absolutely love about this game. 
Fallen Empires. Fallen Empires are basically remnants from past empires that are completely stagnant, but are much, much, MUCH more advanced, numerous, and overall powerful than everyone else, at least until the Late game. They look down on everyone and each have their own special way of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off. Which if you do, you're toast. Overall they add a unique aspect to the balance of power and are indeed pre-established empires, which I think is very cool.
On the other end of the spectrum we have Primitive Civilization. These are pre-FTL species that can range anywhere between Neolithic and Early Space Age. They have many different scenarios and events to spice things up. Like an equivilent to World War 2 for example. Or a nuclear holocaust. And what's more, you can infiltrate their governments to prepare for annexation, or you can technologically uplift them. Or you could just wipe them out if you're feeling especially bloodthirsty today.
Back to the point though. Stellaris was a fun game when I first played it. A little boring, yes. But everything was new. But it was all the game had to offer, sadly. It's likely part of Paradox's DLC plan, but that's beside the point. The game is there, but it needs fleshing out. So if I were you, I'd wait a while for the patches and DLC to come, then I'd consider buying it. But at launch, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Stellaris borrows a lot of core gameplay ideas from other Clausewitz engine titles, but it feels as though Paradox forgot every lesson they learned while iterating those games - a cynic might speculate that such iterative improvements were deliberately left out of Stellaris to be repackaged and sold as DLC add-ons, but that remains mere speculation. Adding to that, several features are bugged or disabled, such as slave revolts and vassal rebellions(ie there is currently no penalty to enslaving pops or vassalizing other empires).
As-is, Stellaris is a very bare-bones space 4X, lacking enough content for long-term gameplay value. Pass on it for now, check back in a few months to a year when the DLC lands(and this review will be updated).			"

 7:30 PM: Started playing. Blinked.
 10:00 PM: After the blink, my sister called and asked for a ride.
 11:00 PM: Resumed playing. Blinked again.

 09:30 AM: Took a break from work and am now writing this. Can't stop thinking about my empire.
Now on to the review!
I seriously can't remember when was the last time I completely lost track of time when playing a game that is so immersive like Stellaris! I think it was when Civ V came out, or maybe Skyrim, but none of those kept me so away from the real world and so focused on what was happening in the game! I seriously loved it! I remember when I first played a 4x space game, I really wanted to like it, but something was missing from it (Distant Worlds). And the same thing happened with all others I tried afterwards. But not Stellaris. This game achieves perfect balance of features, complexity and simplification. It has everything I always wanted on a 4x space game, without any annoyances seen on other games!
Some of the pros:
 Excellent learning curve: Simple at first, gets as complex as you are willing to dig in.
 Micromanagement balance: In the beggining there is a lot, but you have few things to manage, so it's ok (and interesting). Later on, exactly when you start to feel overwhelmed, you learn how to automate planets, by creating sectors).
 Interesting races! Don't be fooled by the small number of species! Each empire you encounter can be a lot different from each other, even if they are of the same major species (avian, reptiles, mammal, etc).
 Superb writing! Every anomaly finding, every faction conversation, reasearch projects, ""quests"", and even descriptions are worth reading! Makes me regret not getting the Galaxy edition, because of the e-book.
 Graphics: they are very cool, a lot more detailed than what is usually the standard for 4x games.
 Sounds and music: Not once I felt the music was boring or repetitive. Sounds are nice, and not those that get tiring after a while and makes you just want to turn the volume down.
 Difficulty: I think the normal dif setting is perfect for new players. I encountered a religious fanatic empire very early in the game, and they quickly declared themselves rivals of my technocratic empire. A cold war started, and eventually I thought I could overpower them and declared war. It's amazing how balanced our fleets were! I won most battles, but each one of them were really, really close! Eventually they surrendered, right when I was about to give up. Simply amazing.
 Customization options: There are a lot of possibilities of customizatiom, from your empire details, to the ship designs. I felt like I only scratched the surface of the possibilities.
 Probably more stuff that I don't remember now.
Now for the cons...
 No central galactic black hole
 Can't put down

281990,wolfjesus,681,959,35,False,77.7,May 26,"To start the review, I have to confess that I wasn't a good paradox fan till last year ---- I  played  cracked version of their games for years, HOI2, EU3, VIC2, HOI3,EU4,CK2, etc. That's my sin and I redeemed it by buying almost all of them in recent 2 years. I feel I could say farewell to my Pirate gaming days and be a legal and good gamer with respect.
Thus I bought Stellaris on launch day, with full pirce, as the first such try in my gaming experience with Paradox.
I played it as crazy, till 40 hours later when a strong feeling of being fooled stormed my mind.
This game, as in its current status, though with best graphics in Paradox games, is only skeleton, fleshless and souless.
I only state one of its many problems: lack of content.
The early game could be fun, meaning you explore and expand and plan cautiously. Yet after a certain point, there's nothing left to do except repeatitive micro management. 
There is no advanced development, since you can only manage 5 to 7 stars and building types are quite limited.
There is no advanced governance, since most of your empire has to be governed by ""Sectors"", but you only have minimum interactions with them, like energy focus and mineral focus. Plus their AI is dumb as hell. 
There is no intense fighting, since: 1. Corvette is extremly OP, you don't really need bigger ships. 2. Formation, Tactics, Strategy, Supply Lines,Morale and meaningful Defence Facilities don't exist. 3. Combat AI doesn't exist as well. The only model of war is : Chase your enemy all around the map (due to no supply lines and real defence or chokepoint)- Grind them automatically(no tactics, formation, morale)- Land troops on their planet, repeat. After your doomstack finishes their doomstack, war is in fact over. No rebuilding a proper fleet, no guerrilla tactics, no desperate defence of their home planet, nothing.
Thre is no politics, since the only functional factions are only separatists and you can easily crack down their hopless revolt by adding more cheap garrisons. No cry for the change of government, no pursuit for another religion, no independence desire from sectors, nothing.
There is no trade, literally. No you can't ship extra food from one planet to another, you can't build markets or trading posts, let alone trade routes, you don't have any ethics or government types with anything raleted to the concept of TRADE.
There is no espionage, literally. No spy, no steal tech, no incite revolt, no support independence, nothing.
There is no advanced diplomacy, since only really functional options are war and alliance-federation(without it there's almost no way for fleet access and tech co-operation ), while the later is unfinished and bugged. You want crisis system in Vic 2? H.R.E system in EU 3/4? Feudal relationships in CK2? Sorry but you must be dreaming. Yes there are some end game crisises, like the Mongol invasion in CK2. But in this universe, no one really cares.
And above is only my incomplete conclusion of one of major problems of this game.  
 I know Paradox fanboys would argue: ""It's just normal for Paradox's game on release status. Paradox will gradually patch the game and add more and more contents to it over time.""
But the issue is they made a shallow beta with just too few features and contents and sell it as if it's finished. Then, maybe 1 or 2 years later, after several Overprieced DLC milking.  We, as their free QA employees, will finally get the ""FULL GAME"" after paying maybe 100 or 200 bucks, with tears and gratitude.
I have admired the ambition of Stellaris and looked foward to promises made by Paradox. I have tried to understand and tolerate the DLC milking practice made by Paradox, since its base games at least seem finished and are even with some suprisingly good features. Sadly, It seems it's a new routine for devs to release unfinished games with full pirce and charge players for so called ""DLCs"" which are actully cut-off contents of base game. Paradox is just one of them.
Suddenly I feel guilty of buying a full priced legal game for the first time, not for the loss of 40 bucks, but for my openly contirbution to the suicidal greed of a once wonderful game developer.			"

281990,76561197993698924,354,500,11,False,9.7,May 15,"I sadly have to agree with the reviews I've read online (and ignored and am regretting it now). It's the kind of game you want to love, but just can't.
The game is well set up, providing a really nice set of mechanics. When you start the game and try it out, it seems great - it has research, it has exploration, space anomalies with interesting texts, even quest chains of sort (even though it's basically always ""go to system and reserach there"". You have factions and different species with changing ethics. Hence why the initial reviews here are very positive.
Problem is that once you've played your first 5 hours and surveyed your first 50 systems, there's suddenly nothing left to do. Enemy empires are passive to say the least, they just squat in their corner of space and ignore you. Resources management is fun at first when you're lacking minerals or energy and need to build new facilities on your worlds and juggle population between them. Alas, as your empire grows, price of development doesn't scale with income, so at some point you stop bothering, since it doesn't really matter if you build a new mine or not, there's nothing to put your resources into anyway (except spamming battleships you don't really need). Colonization loses its appeal, since to colonize new planets, you need to automate some you already have. Factions never do anything. Ethics don't matter.
So at some point instead of ""one more turn"", you catch yourself asking ""why am I even still playing?"". And at that point you quit and realize you feel no urge to start playing again.
I'm dearly hoping for some tweaking that would add some internal and external challanges and would get me busy managing my empire again. Maybe a patch, maybe a datadisk - while I'll be more skeptic, I'm going to buy it if I see good feedback on game websites. I really really want this game to be good. But so far, it isn't.			"

The graphics are beautiful, and the game runs smooth even on my laptop which has an Intel graphic card (using the open source Intel driver).
Second, this is Paradox game with the best tutorial I've ever seen.
It also helps that the UI design is way, way better than their other titles.
Also last but not least, the gameplay. Oh man, it was ridiculously addictive, and deep! Playing for just 2 hours I ran into all kinds of anomalies while exploring the galaxy, making the task of sending a ship to explore unknown stars feel like an episode of Star Treks. From space whales to long lost civilizations. And we haven't even got to other factions yet.
In short, think MoO2, but with all the goodies you expected from Paradox grand strategy game. Each government has its own unique mechanics, each ship is commanded by a captain that has attributes (a la CK2 lite), hell even your goverment is run by a politician who also has attributes and gained experiences, Each planet has pops that works factories or labs, and these pops would also influence how your government is run. Hell, This game is basically the culmination of Paradox grand strategy games, and a very refined one at that.
I'd write more, but I need to get back to my empire. I feel like I barely scratch the surface of what this game has to offer. So, tl;dr is game is good, really, REALLY good. From the gameplay to graphics to sounds. Paradox really hit the homerun with this one			"
281990,thatfuzzytiger,233,326,11,True,35.2,May 14,"Paradox serve up the canvas upon which great stories will be told, and upon which the future of all Science Fiction 4x games must be judged.
So. Stellaris. I think it's safe to say Paradox just dropped a nuclear bomb on the genre. It's not perfect by any means, there are elements of the UI that are in need of polishing, there's AI bugs that need fixing, and there's victory conditions that are missing (diplomacy and science victories of some flavour would be nice, just saying). But what's here entirely changes how you must view the science fiction 4x and strategy genre, in effect, there is pre-Stellaris games, and there is post-Stellaris games. From this point on, everything now must be judged by this benchmark, and if it does not improve on, or innovate from where Stellaris has set the conversation now, then it must be discarded.
In truth I feel sorry for some developers, Stardrive 2 for instance has now been rendered obsolete, because it is effectively a smaller version of Stellaris, it has a subset of the features that Stellaris brings to the table, except everything that Stardrive and Stardrive 2 did, Stellaris does it significantly more adeptly. Ditto for Wargaming, they must have thought the Master of Orion license was a good idea at the time, and that cranking out a merely competent 4X would have been enough to rake in the money. Now? They're going to be feeling more than a little silly.
Stellaris is the lesson from which every developer must learn from, it is the new starting point from which any 4X developer must take heed
In a radical departure from Paradox's traditional Grand Strategy fare, they've wedded 4X to their strengths, and they've created a hybrid, something that begins as a 4X with some grand strategy trappings, and gently evolves into a progressively larger creature over the course of your empire, but all the while keeping those 4X elements in play, so that the game feels fresh and accessible. This is easily the most ""readable"" Paradox strategy game to date, and for people who have had trouble getting into things like Crusader Kings 2, this is a fine place to start.
In another major change, due to the fact you're playing a fledgling race that has just joined the era of space exploration, you are not joining a pre-generated world full of empires that are developed and settled down. Whilst I imagine that some enterprising modders are going to create such games where empires are already ""bedded in"" and you can select your empire from a list to define what kind of experience you have, here you start as a tabula rasa, and your choices right from race creation inform the kind of experience you will have over the course of the game. 
Whether you will be dealing in diplomacy or warfare, whether science or faith is your guiding light, whether you welcome alien races with open arms or a guarded response. The game shapes itself and its narrative around your choices and considerations, meaning that there is a ludicrous level of replayability, not to mention the randomly drawn stories that can occur within your playthroughs. This is a game where no two playthroughs will ever be remotely the same, and where a single playthrough will have moments memorable enough that two Stellaris players will be able to share ""war stories"" that whilst incredibly different, will have both of them finding common ground in the way the game has brought people together.
Ship building too, whilst initially simplistic looking at the Corvette level, quickly blossoms into a varied and wonderful thing where Cruisers and Destroyers are assembled from a jigsaw of pieces and module components to create multiple designs which fit your needs as and when you need them. Weapon types start off with ""obvious enough"" but research can take you down some very unexpected directions if you're lucky. 
Science advantages aren't quite as obvious as they seem, thanks to some clever design
Research itself is presented in such a way that it draws cards from a deck, a deck constructed from researches that you've gained the pre-requisites to unlock, but you'll only be able to draw so many from at a given time. This means you can ""hazily"" guide research if you stick down certain branches, but you'll have to improvise and adjust your short term goals from time to time. It's a clever system, rewarding races who take the option of extra research picks by allowing them to not research ""faster"" but research ""smarter"", whilst at the same time keeping the field fairly level and preventing any one person from overspecialising down a single path to attempt to brute force a technological advantage.
This doesn't even touch upon mid-game diplomacy and federations, where the shifting nature of alliances means that you'll need to cultivate friendships by establishing diplomacies, and with clever use of insults and gifts, you can set up wars which work out in your favour, even forcing foes who were at one time implacably hostile to change their world view and eventually capitulate and become new allies after recognising the error of their ways. It's incredible stuff.
Final thoughts
Stellaris is not just a game that's mandatory for any fan of Sci-fi 4x. It's mandatory for any prospective developer of Sci-fi 4x too, because if you intend to compete in this field, this is what you need to stand up against. Paradox haven't just stormed the field, they've entirely redefined it. From this point forth, this is what you will be judged against, and woe betide you if you come up short.
If Paradox follow through on their intent for long term DLC for Stellaris, they could quite easily suffocate the market in this genre, a feat not achieved since World of Warcraft sucked out the oxygen from the paid subscription MMO market.
Verdict : Essential, and consider this the marker to be put up against in future if you're a sci-fi 4x "
281990,fhmansen,147,198,9,True,97.0,May 9,"(Excerpt of my review here: http://www.tweak.dk/review/Stellaris/2660/1/1)
""With only a ”mere” 20 or so hours with the game, I have barely begun to scratch the surface in Stellaris. If I know Paradox (and I think I do) there are many, many more hours of entertainment to be had because of the dynamically generated gameplay, where every universe you create is unique.
In my opinion, Stellaris brings a much needed breath of fresh air to an otherwise stagnated 4X strategy genre, where almost every game is in part inspired by either Civilization or the Master of Orion series. It’s done with a finish rarely seen outside of big budget, big studio productions – with a very small team. Stellaris has an excellent combination of freedom of design and deep political system that we don’t see nearly enough of in my opinion.
 
The pace of the game is great for the most part, starting out with a complete hands on control of the empire early on, while slowly handing off more and more power to local governors that can administrate entire regions of systems for you, in exchange for more autonomy and a reduced tax rate. Your neighbors react in a very realistic manner to your world views – which can very easily lead to war. I can say from personal experience that being pro-slavery is not easy when you’re surrounded by pacifist hippies – who suddenly seem less interested in peace, and much more focused on plotting your inevitable demise and raising war fleets to accomplish that.
 
I’ve really enjoyed my time with Stellaris, and I’m sure I’ll be having many more late nights of playing it over the coming years. I have minor gripes with how automation of ships work (or the lack thereof), where I definitely think it should have been an option. Information about mechanics and choices is also a little on the light side at times. With all of that in mind, I’ve come to a final score for Stellaris of 9 (and a half...appendage). It falls just shy of a full 10 at current, but knowing Paradox’s DLC model, they will easily make it there in time…and maybe more.""			"
281990,76561197996186863,977,"1,470",72,False,1.7,May 20,"This will be a terrific game in about twenty more patches and with a good $200 worth of DLC modules added, because that's how Paradox rolls now.  After all, it worked for Crusader Kings 2.  That's not sarcasm, by the way.
Seriously, it did work for CK2.  That's an awesome game and I've sunk far more time & money into it than I'd care to admit.  All that extra stuff has left me spoiled - I admit it - and nothing else than having that level of depth & complexity does it for me anymore.  Which I'm sure is exactly the way Paradox wanted it.  Their DLC model is perfectly addictive and it works.  The simple stuff is cheap, the deeper stuff costs a bit more, and you're never having your arm twisted to buy more than you want.  
But I also know that if I ever booted it up today with all those mods and all that DLC turned off I'd fall asleep on my own keyboard in fifteen minutes.  Like with any other addiction, you build up a tolerance.  You need that bigger dose to get anything out of it.  Which is fine once you've already got all that stuff.
Stellaris, on the other hand, doesn't have all that other stuff yet.  Don't believe me?  Think about their espionage system.  Oh, that's right, there isn't any.  Kind of odd that would be completely missing in a modern x4 game, isn't it?  Can you think of any other games in the x4 genre to come out in the last decade that doesn't have spies in any form?  
Yet here we are, completely lacking one, and why do you think that is?  Because it's going to be added latter.  Along side everything else that is so obviously missing.  After all, you can only pretend to be exicted about discovering the exact same four alien species (gas grazers, crystals, etc) so many times.  Anomalies may be interesting the first time you see them, but come back in a month and see if you actually stop to read any of those info-blurbs.  You won't, because you've read them all fifty times already & now it's dull.  In fact, once that initial ""new game"" buzz wears off everything is going to feel dull real quick.
Which is exactly what they want, because that's when the DLC train is going to start rolling in with twenty boxcars behind it.  Slowly but surely, dollar by dollar, Stellaris will indeed evolve into one of the greatest x4 space opera games ever made.  It may end up taking five years and costing you two hundred bucks, but as someone who's already been there with CK2, I can assure you that somehow it will feel worth it.  Seriously, it will.  And I have no problem with that.  It's a good system - it works.  I applaud their marketing technique.  It is brilliant.
All I am saying is that right now is not the time to jump onto the Stellaris bandwagon.  Give it a little while and the patches will roll in, the price will come down, and the first DLCs will come out to start filling all the glaring empty spaces in the current game design.
In short, come back in a year and I'm certain this review will be a very happy thumbs up.  But until then it's probably best to not pick up the habit until there's actually more out there to feed the addiction, otherwise you'll be left wanting.			"

It really gives you a feeling of running an interstellar empire with gameplay that includes managing the ethos and expectations of your subjects, administrative sectors and more. There is always something interesting to do, with random events, planet development, empire management and ongoing politics.
The game is incredibly well presented. Everything is gorgeous and the music is fantastic. 
The user interface is a dream to use with mouse over information, right click menus, queuing up orders, and various screens.
There is strategy in your fleet design and choosing the right technologies to gain an edge over your opponents is important. Then you watch the battle play out. It looks fantastic.
The technology system is fantastic with random choices each time you finish a tech. There is a lot of depth to the technology system and hard choices to make sometimes on what to research.

Midgame is unsatisfying micromanagement and the endgame is bare.  The technologies are not interesting and weaponry is a simple rock-paper-scissors type deal despite the scifi name.  Currently balancing is terrible, so there are lots of invincible strategies that break the spirit of the game.
It lacks enough variety for 4X, and unlike their historical games there is no character.  Don't expect political intrigue within or between empires.  The sectors do nothing, similar to activating a governor in old Civ.  All of the aliens have similar behavior behind their flavor text, and the same dozen or so events happen all the time.  For example, in a typical game you will 'unexpectedly discover' a gigantic alien carcass about 20 times, and when you investigate the result is exactly the same.  It gets tedious very quickly.

I really like this game. It is a lot of fun. Stellaris is much more than the typical Space 4X game.
I play on super slow most of the time, which is why I have a lot of hours but have yet to finish a game. My first game went wrong, I was in a nebula so my fleets moved slower, but worse I had no minerals. After 20 years of gameplay I had mineral income of 12 per month. I could have stuck with it as there was a very weak enemy Empire I coud take out, but I restarted.
My second game is great! I have room to expand and even won two wars so far.
Stellaris has neat technology system, where you get to choose from 3 different techs each time. SOmetimes techs are different to choose from, so you have to choose the best for you when you can.
Diplomacy is ... WOW! You can trade, set rivals, have embassies. There are also alliances and federations.
Also, the population management system is full-blown. I have a binch of conquered worlds where the pops have Fanatic Xenophobic ethos = thta means they hate aliens, meaning me. Err, these pops are hard to manage! FUN !!! I guess over time things will smooth out.
Love the ships and the ship design system. Ships have slots to place Weapons, Defenses+Reactors and also Support. I like designing the ships from time to time, and refits are a snap to handle.
Oh, part of playing is sending out Science ships and Construction ships. This means a little bit of micro-management. I like it, others don't.
The early game is slowwwwww .... some players would get bored, but I love it.
Graphics are nice and the soundtrack is wonderful.
I really enjoy this game. It is now one of my favorites, I am certain Paradox will improve the game even more. Currently there are no game breaking bugs, but there are a few quirks here and there.
Overall, Stellaris is a great game!			"
281990,76561198079336898,305,463,10,False,68.4,May 15,"Stellaris launched as a skeleton for DLC and, as a result, has very little in the way of meaty content. The game is an ostensible fusion of Grand Strategy and 4X, featuring massive scale, intragovernmental management, POPs, strategic resources, government types, etc. While it has the makings of the 4Xs and a smattering of strategy, it fails in both regards. I cannot recommend it in its present state.
The game utterly lacks any deep systems outside of population management; there is no intergalactic economy to speak of, no trade routes, no logistical considerations for war (no fuel or ammunition), very limited options when declaring war (you can only conquer/liberate/vassalize planets/systems/empires, respectively; you cannot enforce government types, abduct citizens, execute leaders, or claim unsettled systems), very little in the way of planetary management (the sector system ensures that you'll rarely hold any more than 10 planets in a given game, whereas the galaxy can contain several hundred; on top of that, it's basically a similar version of GalCiv2's planet management screen with clunkier automation - you develop tiles and place people on them, that's it), very little control over research, and no espionage. You do a lot of clicking to affect little direct change.
The leader system, where you can recruit extraordinary citizens from available populations in your empire, boils down to nothing more than a bunch of timed, growable modifiers. Leaders have no personality whatsoever. They do not trigger trait-specific events, and they have no effect on interactions with other empires unless they have traits that do. There are no feuds between two God-Emperors, no presidents detested by embittered rival empires, no events dealing with leaders of other empires, or anything of the sort. Contrast with CK2, where the characters of your leaders vastly affects the composition of your realm, even in vanilla.
What depth there is remains inconsequential in most playthroughs. It's not like CK2, where you have to learn the ins-and-outs of managing vassals to have a shot at governing a large empire. I completely neglected my POPs beyond throwing down a few happiness buildings and paying off factions, and yet I've still yet to have one rebellion break out across multiple games, even when I've integrated fairly large, unhappy populations. I haven't even bothered with gene modifiation since I'm doing just fine without that kind of expensive, time-consuming optimization.
Everywhere you look, it feels like something is missing. Interactions with other empires boils down to conquering them or allying with them and conqering them later. POPs management consists of spamming certain resources when factions get unruly and colonizing certain planets with certain species. War is a rock/paper/scissors spam-off where corvettes dominate the meta. Dealing with primitives involves picking one of four options and waiting, or just invading them like you would an AI - except it's even easier. Research consists of crossing your fingers and waiting for the game to generate the techs you want. Managing planets stays the same all throughout the game since anything beyond your first few get relegated to self-governing, inefficient sectors. There's just nothing worth engaging with, mechanically. Even exploration, the best-executed feature in the game, becomes worthless once you're either boxed in or you've already gathered data on other systems via map exchanges in a buggy, antiquated trading interface.
Buy something like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion instead. At least that game has compelling combat.			"

Still, a very good move.

I dont hate the game, but if you want a full experience, it is not here. The start of the game is done, and that is it.
It takes a long time to play because nothing happens unless you want to just go around and kill everybody, and combat is lackluster, so that will get stale quick too. 
You will easily spend tens of hours just moving science and construction ships around the map in a normal game waiting on something to happen.

However, this game is SEVERLEY lacking depth. The diplomacy which is primarily the reason i play paradox games as opposed to Total War is almost non existant. There is no trading mechanic whatsoever. And it generally feels incomplete as a game, and you ultimately seem ot be doing the same thing over and over again. 
Yet, this is where i have the problem with saying i dont reccommend the game. 
It is fun for the first few hours, and i do want to continue to play it, but im now playing a bit at a time and being bored because it is the same thing over and over again... explore this star system, investigate this anomaly...its great while youre exploring and understnding everything, but then its just the same thing over and over again. 
And then you begin to see just how shallow this is as a game, it really does feel like Paradox are using this as a vechle to sell DLC, which normally i dont have a problem with their DLC policy, but this game does lack such depth it does lead me to think that they have stripped it of features in order to add them back in at a later date at a cost. 
So, yeah this game WILL be very good, and im very excited for the next 12 months of this games development, but perhaps if youre cash strapped, wait for a sale. Honestly. .. Its the same thing over and over again.			"

The game is awesome. It's smooth, elegant, sounds great, looks great, and is stable. 
This is no trivial game that you can master, finish and discard in a couple dozen hours. 
I imagine this is a game I will continue playing for months, if not years, especially as new content is released. Stellaris is a STRATEGY game, and makes no bones about it, as there is barely even a nod towards tactical elements.
The one thing I love about Stellaris above most other games in this genre .... there are actual STAR SYSTEMS, not just planets floating in space or arbitrary placeholders. Ships which warp or jump into a system have to traverse the system or wait for their jump drives to cool down before they can jump again. As an immersive factor, this WORKS for me.
The nature of the game is TOTALLY suited to modding and customisation. I can imagine people designing the entire star wars galaxy or star trek galaxy or empire of man or warhammer 40k universe or starcraft universe in this. I literally cannot wait to see what modders will do in terms of race design, 3d models, static galaxy designs, story driven gameplay, event chains, etc.
Stellaris has given a massive POKE IN THE EYE to those who think 4x games cannot encompass multiple stardrive types and should be simplified to managing hyperlane bottlenecks. 
You will love it if
- you like sandbox games
- you want control of customisation
- you want to set your own goals, and drive your own agenda
- you love science fiction stories, as the anomalies and events in the game are like a story unfolding, absolutely amazing.
You will hate it if
- you are a twitch gamer wanting a rail-shooter in space
- you want the game to drive the agenda for you
- you just wanna kill things and couldn't be bothered to read.
Being a sandbox, i imagine it will suit the multiplayer environment much better than the single player environment, but it is still an awesome single player experience.
There are a few things missing, but they detract very little from the game experience.
- there are only randomly generated games, no campaign modes
- there are no freighters, passenger ships, trade routes, etc.
- the game is pseudo 3d, and effectively plays out on a flat galaxy map
- no tactical combat mode, but its well done, with combat seamlessly playing outin real time on the strategic map.
- current diplomacy is not that complex, no espionage, sabotage, etc. But the sheer number of species and diversity adds its own complexity.
- being a sandbox, there is currently no campaign, but I am sure the modding community will solve this.
- while there are leaders (governals, admirals, scientists, etc) with traits, experience and skills, they are randomly generated, not a result of a complex relationship engine as in CK2. Not a big deal to me, but I imagine some would have hoped for this. I can imagne a system like rome total war with governing families leading factions might have worked.
Many of the tricks the designers missed in the realease version, I imagine can be added in future content, or through modding.			"
281990,Chilson,49,60,3,True,18.6,May 11,"I give this a tepid recomendation. A lot of Paradox fanboy's are giving this a lot of hype (as other steam reviews will demonstrate), but i don't actually feel this game deserves that much praise. where to start
GOOD
-Customization is wonderful, it is just awesome
-The initial gameplay of explore, colonize, research, fight small skirmishes, and all the other typical 4x systems work enough to make you feel excited and keep you occupied at the beggining of the game.
-it good to be able to micro manage planets and not make it feel like a boring chore *cough* CK2 casltes *cough*
-the way you research is actually fun and engaging
-micro managing fleets, fleet armanents and building defensive structures can actually be really fun.
-MULTIPLAYER IS AWESOME, JUST STELLAR
BAD
-diplomacy....what the hell happened to diplomacy??? green and red opinion modifiers are nothing new, but there is no feeling that these other species are alive. its all about getting that trade bar at ""1 green"" when trading and that is all that matters with AI. at least with EU4 and CK2 i felt that there were some ""people"" behind the decisions and not just a literal green modifier that forces them to accept no matter what.
-forming alliances and federations is a hassle since the alliance has to approve wars (you can't go solo when in an alliance) and federations change presidents, causing the AI to take control and do something stupid. federations can also overlap with some species, meaning if i attack species ""x"" in federation ""x"" with species ""Y"" who also happens to be a different federation called ""Y"" then it calls both federations Y and X into the war even though i am not declaring on species Y. I don't know if this is a bug, but its dumb ethier way.
-battles are non interactive and you can barely see all those minor improvements you painstakingly updgraded and researched for your fleets.
-science ships and construction ships become a hassle in the late game since you have to manually control them, take a lesson from Civilzation and add an explore or auto build button.
-planets become a hassle as you get to the late game, making it clear the UI was clearly not designed for super late game.
-wars take way to long at the late game, i have spent 30 years sieging half this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s planets and destorying his fleets. but he won't surrender because there is no war exhaustion system, at least i don't believe so.
to sum it up. early game-mid game are quite fun, but late game is a micro managing hell that the UI was not designed for, wars are not that interesting due to how stale the battles are, and diplomacy is boring. However, all these problems (not the UI one, but i can live with that) are fixed by the stellar mulitplayer and that was what this game was really designed for considering how Paradox marketed it for. hell the first button on the home screen is multiplayer and not single player. i just wish more time and energy went to the UI and single player.

Another hour of looking at all the options and stuff, before un pausing the game. As well as only un pausing it every so often to make decisions and or check status of my first contacts etc.
Shows me one thing about this game, and that is.... I absolutly love it.
I know it's the early game, but this game has everything I personally love, space, ships, exploration, Oh crap moments, some neat stories that pop up. The first contact page popped up and I thought the enimies were at earth, I about freaked out, getting my small weak fleet ready. To then find out they were a few galaxies away, and I had some time to prepare and check them out. 
I will admit I am a sucker for space games, especially ones where I can rule the galaxy, and have control over it, all while role playing. This game is neat cause instead of me role-playing a single character, I get to role-play a whole species, which for the first run is human. I will admit it's a hard task to role-play us humans and try to do what I believe we would do in this situation, but I am up for the task. 
The game is running great for me at the moment, I am one of the lucky ones not affected by the studdering bug (hope they fix it for those who are). I like the way the galaxy is set up, as well as the animations of your ships while they do there tasks. The map seems easy enough to understand, and the ability to find stuff seems painless. The UI is ok in the game, I do wish you could scale it, without having to adjust numbers in the game files. Playing on a large screen TV or at high resolution can make you squint a bit. 
The designes of the ships and aliens in the game are awsome, and the fact that the aliens are random is another nice touch. The first contact I made with are basically ameba's, and they really don't look friendly lol. The ship designes I have seen in vids are great, the one where the ship is alive, reminds me of farscape. 
Even though I am early in my playthrough my first impressions of the game are good, for me personally it is what I had hoped it would be. I do realise that late game changes things up a bit, and the game slows down, but I imagine they will add DLC to make the end game more complex. It don't hurt that I am running the largest galaxy possible, with as many species as possible. The fact that it took me 3 hours to make my government and another hour just looking at options, I won't be getting to end game for awhile lol.

-Huge chunks of features (for example, ""respect tile resources"" under the sector management) are completely broken and do nothing. I won't even begin to list them all, but...
-The whole factions and rebellions system is completely dead on arrival. Slaves can't revolt, because they haven't fleshed out the design for how slavery revolts will work yet (or so we are told). So, is there a faction you don't like? Just enslave their pops. 
-The AI ignores deadly late-game crises that become unstoppable when they are not dealt with quickly, and would probably be way too incompetent to handle them even if they didn't ignore them. If these crises don't happen in your corner of the galaxy you'd better vassalize a path to the crisis, because basic diplomatic needs like military access are impossible without war.
-Speaking of which, the vassalization mechanic is completely broken - any empire can be vassalized with 60% warscore, which makes conquering the galaxy comically easy.
-AI neightbors usually just sit around and act passive. Some expand more than others, but with the exception of fanatical purifies (who will attack), nothing interesting really happens throughout the course of a game and you will choose who to attack on your terms. The early game is interesting the first time you play it; after that, not so much compared to Civ, EU4, DW, pick your game.
-The only way to ""win"" is through conquest of the galaxy, no diplomatic, scientific means, etc.
-Once you colonize more than 5-7 planets, the rest will go into sectors which are AI-governened. Unfortunately, the sector management AI is completely incompetent. It builds and then immediately razes farms some times, and other times sits on huge stockpiles of resources and doesn't build anything while your pops sit there severely underproducing because they are working a tile without buildings.
-The above problem wouldn't be so bad except as you get to Hard or Impossible difficulty. Your technology cost scales to your population - so for example a large empire has +900% tech cost - so these suboptimized sectors are a huge technology liability. Hard and Impossible difficulties give artificial (50% and 100%) bonuses to all resources, including research, so sectors become a huge technological liability, and in order to keep research parity on hard you willl micromanage every planet.
-After they fix the most glaring problems, the random events, crystalline alien lifeforms, etc. are extremely fun on the first playthrough, but quickly become repetitive.			"

However, after playing for 15 hours, I now have the feeling that I am playing an unfinished version of Europa Universalis 4.
For example, in EU4, you are told by the game why an ally is refusing to go to war with you, i.e. because he has good relations with your enemy or because he currently cannot afford another war because he is still recovering from a previous war. In Stellaris, however, you simply are told that your ally is saying no, without providing any hint on the reasons why he is doing so.
I have also encountered several serious bugs in the game.
I assume that Paradox (the publisher and developer) will continue to develop the game and improve it significantly, as it has done with EU4. Quite a few of these improvements for EU4 were free. However, many were very expensive. Currently, if you buy all DLC for EU4, it will cost you over 220 Euros, which is equivalent to 250 US-Dollars. I'm afraid that Stellaris will suffer the same fate.

281990,EdenStarGazer,75,110,0,True,127.9,May 14,"A Romp & Stomp Through the Stars The Grand Strategy/4X Hybrid that is a true paradox on a 2D map, with mechanics that feel so 3D you’ll forget you’re not in space. To explain the basics of Paradox Studio’s latest thrill ride, a riddle: 
In a rectangular room, 30’X12’X12’, a spider is at the middle of an end wall, one foot from the ceiling. The fly is at the middle of the opposite end wall, 1 foot above the floor. The fly is scared & can’t move. What is the shortest distance the spider must crawl to capture the fly? 
Are you scratching this out on paper already? Either way, Stellaris is likely for you. Gameplay focuses on combat & exploration. The Math is done by the game. Everything: from the stats the AI uses, to the strength of opposing forces in battle, is transparent in the game. You explore the Galaxy, but have to fight for control. Features include land armies, naval ships you can build to spec, & pirates.
Grand Strategy: Grand Strat is a balancing act of managing many complex features of the game at once like a waitress with arms loaded with plates. But here, instead of micro-managing, you have the unique ability to delegate whole Solar Systems to Sector management by the AI, while you concentrate on the macro-management/ big picture dev of your empire. You control the leaders, Scientists, & Construction Ships (CS) that carry out your orders. Simply clicking on the sun of a solar system (SS), while having a CS selected, will present order options so that you can queue up research stations (RS) or mines for the whole SS for example. But, anytime you don’t like the direction something is going, you can seize control & redirect. 
4X Popular for a Reason: I love TBS 4X games like Civ 5, where you accumulate wealth & dominate the world to the tune of a victory condition, while taking turns with the AI civs. Traditionally, Grand Strat games leave that aside for a strictly sandbox style where you walk out on the world stage and wonder what to do 1st. But, Stellaris is like a gateway drug into the world of Grand Strat. You can see the basic goals of the game, & you know where you want to go, without any hand-holding.
Gameplay: The goal of the game is to wander the galaxy, researching as many SS’s as you can, while building colonies, mines, or RS’s on them. The zone around the outside of your empire is your known world, which you push outward as you explore with your ships. You can’t build there, unless you totally explore the SS, & then build a frontier outpost on the star to push out the borders of your empire in any direction you outpost. Then it’s yours & you can build. But, you are limited by resources, energy, & especially influence, because it builds up slowly over time. Certain tasks, like meeting leader mandates, will give bonuses in influence. 
Build a decent navy of at least 2 fleets. Send 1 fleet with the Science ship, & 1 with the CS, & zip from planet to planet laying claim. Just be careful not to “forward settle” the AI empires. If you claim a star close to an AI, they see this as aggression, and they will destroy you before you’ve had time to build a big navy. Cautiously, take stars to either side of AI, & leave buffer stars until you are ready to fight. 
Meanwhile, you will encounter either “nasty aliens” if you are a Xenophobe, or intriguing alien races, if you have a Xenophile type personality. You can either fight or flee to safe planets in the early game stage of exploration & colonization. In the mid-game, you must begin to form alliances & trade networks, or begin waging war to take resources from other empires. Late game, game-changing special events occur. 
Winning & losing: Unlike most grand strat games, Stellaris has winning conditions. You can win by domination, or by colonizing 40% of the habitable planets. To score achievies, you must select Ironman mode, which is really no big deal in Paradox games. Many achievies are easily obtained without winning the game.
Emergent Story-telling: Stellaris reminds me of XCOM in the way you get to choose which research you will focus on, directing your own course. Meanwhile, event chains are unraveled through popups, with story to read. It gives the added romp of a great RPG by allowing you to see unexpected events unfold in a Sci-fi narrative that is extremely playful & intriguing. 
Pros: 
*Narrative is extensive; Soundtrack, Graphics & art are great 
*DLC provides enjoyable ringtones, e-book novel & artbook 
*Feature Rich & Fully customizable creative experience
Cons: 
*Tutorial an annoyance to be turned off; see key mapping in options
*Situation Log sketchy; Outliner needs to be longer to view more info
*MP causes desync issues on low-end machines/ rural satellite internet 
Stellaris is a stellar Sci-fi strategy game with extreme re-play value. With 100+ hours in the week since release, the game is addictive, time-consuming, & one of the best gaming experiences in the galaxy. I highly recommend it for gamers of all ages who enjoy info intensive strategy games.			"

Early game is exploring and expanding which is not tiresome. But spending dozens of years doing nothing because of Federation mechanics or because of absurdly long peace treaty...
Not to mention a crisis going on on the other side of aggresive AIs preventing you help solving the sh*t before it get out of hand...
The game could have been fun with a real diplomacy system (not locked by ethos or with a special ethos that let us speak with everyone) and real victory conditions (right now its Enslaving War or Wipe War).

281990,Dipex,363,595,10,False,76.7,May 14,"This game is getting a lot of amazing reviews on Steam, but it really doesn't deserve them *at this point*, as the game has a tremendous amount of problems.
By far the biggest problem is the lack of a competent UI and some very basic automation features.  
For example, there is no screen from which you can see/give build orders to your spaceports.  Likewise, there is no way to rally production from your spaceports.  This all makes building up a fleet in a large empire unnecessarily tedious.  
Upgrading ships also feels like it wasn't playtested.  There is a flat time cost to upgrading a ship regardless of how much you're changing on it - and that cost is very close to the time cost of building a completely new ship.  This means it isn't usually worth upgrading ships for marginal improvements, and makes upgrading large fleets quite tedious.  Unless you want your fleets to be locked in dock for a *very long time* you need to split them up multiple times and then scatter them across your empire, keeping in mind that, again, you have no way of telling where your spaceports are short of manually searching every system on the map.
Now, producing/upgrading ships isn't a problem in the early game when you only have a few systems.  But the scale of Stellaris means that by the late game you may have upwards of 100 systems, at which point the poor UI makes these very core, basic tasks overwhelmingly tedious.  
The game would be infinitely better if there was just a screen that you could control and rally production from, if the time cost of upgrading a ship was based on the work actually being done to the ship, and if there was a button you could click that would just automatically break a fleet up into smaller chunks and send them off to be upgraded.  Or, alternatively, a way to just set spaceports to contribute their production to a centralized spaceport.  For example, if every spaceport in a sector automatically added its production capacity to the sector capital spaceport so that the capital spaceport could very rapidly produce/upgrade ships while the rest of the sector's spaceports were inaccessible.  
There is also no autoexplore option for your science vessels, which isn't a huge deal in the early game but in an 800 star sized map, you basically just reach a point where you stop exploring because you've explored your immediate area of the galaxy and exploring the far off reaches is extremely tedious and of very limited strategic value.  *Every* 4x game released in the last 4 years has had an autoexplore feature, and for Stellaris not to have one is inexcusable. 
Which leads me to the main point of why the game sucks in its current state - which is that it just doesn't feel like it was playtested past the first few hours (which is something that Paradox is notorious for).  The basic systems and mechanics in the game are all good and fun, but their implementation is just poor in general.  And that poor implementation itself just comes from things being slightly off - things that don't require much testing to notice or much work to fix.  
I could probably write a doctoral thesis on all of the small things wrong with diplomacy, sectors, fleet combat, and the UI (other than what I've already mentioned), but its probably easier and more effective to just sum the current problems up with an analogy.  The current state of Stellaris feels like if you hired someone to paint your house, and while he did a good job on what he painted he also left small sections of every room unpainted.  You would look at that and say ""I mean sure he knows what he's doing but he needs to get back in here and finish painting the walls.""  Thats basically Stellaris.
None of its current problems feels like they will be hard to fix, and Paradox has a history of continuing active development on their games.  In fact, Stellaris is no different than any other Paradox game in that respect - with Paradox games you always pay full price for a beta version of the game that gets its major problems fixed over the next 6 months in patches, with major feature improvements regularly released as $30 DLC.  Its just dissapointing because starting with HOI3 they promised to stop doing the whole ""paying for a beta"" thing.  But they haven't yet made good on that promise and Stellaris is no exception.  
If you're looking to buy Stellaris I would hold off right now and check back in a month or two once the game has been patched a bit, because right now it really needs it.			"
281990,76561198039463852,345,565,14,False,92.1,May 23,"Notice my hours played.
Notice the hours played for many others who give the game thumbs down.
I started to write a very long review to describe each aspect of the game and how I feel the Devs dropped the ball - but instead I'll just focus upon what I believe is the most broken part of the game:  Diplomacy.
Stellaris uses the same old Diplomacy that pretty much every other 4x game uses - and it's awful.  The system itself is broken and no amount of tinkering is going to fix it.   Either the player is able to predictably benefit from interacting with the other Race, in which case the player will do so, or the player is going to ignore the Diplomacy system - in which case it is nothing more than a bother. 
For me, Star Ruler 2 is the best Space 4x game to be released so far, and this game adds very little to the genre.  The event system is nice - but they need to add hundreds more events because right now the same handful of events are repeated over and over.  
I give Stellaris a thumbs down, even though it's not a horrible game.  Maybe after some more patches/mods/content is released - I'll write a new review, but for now I'd recommend staying away from it.			"
281990,76561198064522419,83,124,2,False,16.5,May 17,"First of all, to make things clear â€” Stellaris is by no means a bad game. However, reading the community reviews here one would think that it is the ""promised game""  of the strategy genre, some people describing it as the ""best strategy game"" and such. This surprises me. In my experience, Stellaris is a fairly bland game that doesn't bring much (or maybe even  anything) new to the table. Its definitely playable and even enjoyable, but it gets boring and tedious fairly quickly. I wouldn't know if it has a lot of depth, as others often claim about it. It certainly has a lot of ""breadth"" though, in form of modifiers that affect all kinds of stuff as well as small micromanagement minigames. One needs to learn all that stuff in order to be successful. At the same time, the sole purpose the minigames seems to keep the player occupied. 
Take for instance the planet management. Its still the basic old assign-props-to-tiles-and-build-improvements minigame we know from many games before, made slightly more 'complex' by adjacency bonuses. Yes, it gives the player something to do and it seems to offer a 'choice' â€” but this choice is merely an illusion. In the end, optimal tile development is a linear optimisation problem (what gamers often refer to as min-maxing), an additional puzzle game within the larger game where the player is rewarded by playing the puzzle well and punished by playing it badly. I never understood why I have to play puzzle games of this sort when I want to play a 4X strategy game. Now, while Stellaris generally is quite micromanagement-heavy (planetary survey being one of other annoying things), it also attempts to cut down on micromanagement by introducing sectors, which are basically ""AI"" assistants that take over management of planetary systems. However, they do it spectacularly badly. The funny thing is that the planet development minigame can be solved by the computer optimally. This is not a particularly difficult problem and algorithms to solve it have existed for decades. Not within the Stellaris universe apparently. Other things that disappoints: the diplomacy system, trading and don't get me started on the leader system. First of all, leaders/heroes have a limited life span, which sounds like a neat feature on paper but is incredibly annoying in practice. Second, leaders can be elected president, which immediately stops them from doing what they are doing and essentially removes them from the game. You need to manually(!) look through all your leader assignments, find out/guess which slot now became empty and hire/find a replacement. Combat is ok, even though quite basic. Some more control of fleet tactics would be nice (such as ordering sniper ships to at least try keep their optimal distance from the opponent). 
All in all, in my view at least, Stellaris is mostly a combination of old and not very exiting ideas in a new package. Now, there are some things that are quite neat, like the heavy utilisation of random events (storytelling, research, etc.) which do offer meaningful choices. But the tedious micromanagement and non-exiting gameplay are still big downers in my book. I would have wished for the game to try more advanced/novel solutions instead of pushing the player into the old boring micromanagement minigames.

281990,l11enk,123,194,4,False,60.9,May 11,"Review for Stellaris
At full price? I can't recommend, for a number of reasons, of which I will go into further into this review. TL;DR would be that it is a pretty shallow and though polished, it is rather undeveloped and the developers have purposesfully left a lot to want in preparation for DLC spam.
If you want to know what sort of spam, just look at CK2's DLC list. Fourty plus items, if I recall correctly. Although you can get them pretty cheap given enough time during sales, it is still a hefty amount for a hefty sum.
At a sale price or after some updates and possibly an expansion or two, Stellaris could very well be worth the money spent. However, at this point in time it is impossible to know exactly where it will go.
Paradox is good at making feature rich games like Crusader Kings 2 (CK2), Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), but getting there takes time. Some of their games have had rocky starts and have a decent amount of content, others like Stellaris have had thus far a smooth and stable start, but are very much lacking in content.
The Good
+ Stable multiplayer. Did an eight-hour long game with twenty others in a group I play with without a single hiccup at all. Smooth as silk, with working hotjoin! A big surprise, given how broken multiplayer is in say, Crusader Kings 2 at times.
+ Diverse selection of species. Unfortunantly they don't have quite as big as an impact as one might wish for, more onto that later. But cool designs and a reasonably large number to choose from, which is always sweet.
+ You can customise your starting ethics and racial traits. All species have access to the same traits sadly. Ethics/Ethos allow you to be peaceful, militaristic and so on. You can make your political makeup somewhat unique compared to other playthroughs. Only a couple are actually viable for competetive multiplayer, though.
+ Ship editing and customisation. It's there, it does the job. Not the most sophisticated system around, and somewhat lacking compared to other games in the genre.
+ Purges, enslavement and eugeni- uh. Racial modifications. Uplift other species and over time force them to submit to your ethics, modify them as you will.
+ Political 'map' in mid to late game reminds one of games such as EVE. Large empires can wage huge wars, federations form and politics can get interesting. On MP, at least. AI is rather lackluster and not very good at that sort of thing. Or staying alive, either.
+ Large scale. Number of stars isn't everything, and games like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion prove as much, but it honestly helps create a sense of awe in space.
The Bad
+ Ship combat system is incredibly simplistic, in a very bad way. Factors such as range not being used (LRMs will engage in melee like every other ship, for example, instead of staying at their max range) and the complete lack of control over ship orders and priority targets leaves battles completely at the mercy of RNG and your ship compositions. AI isn't very good at countering player navy makeups, if it even tries at all. You can't even tell your fleet to target specific high value targets in a fleet.
= Could be fixed by moving the system to something closer to what is in Endless Space, as the combat system does sort of emulate what is used in that game, but is less complex for it lacks difference phases (Long range, medium range, melee and tactics).
= Could be fixed by moving the system into something closer to Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Different ship types serve a different purpse; LRMs will sit back out of harm's way, whilst corvettes and destroyers armed with lasers and short range kinetics will engage in melee sort of thing. Give commander the ability to pick which targets (individual ships in an engaged fleet) the fleet focuses on, or what certain ships should focus on.
= Something between the two could be good, maybe. Really, anything other than what it is now would be better.
= Because come on, Star Ruler 2, Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion all do space combat far better. SR2 is made by a tiny (two?) man team in their free time, and is leagues better between the customization system and combat!
+ Planet classes only affect two things; when you can colonise it -> The required pre-requisite technology and the resulting habitability (which affects in turn how fast pop grows), which is based on your starting planet class. Then graphics, what the planet 'looks like'.
= Some planets, like Tomb worlds, being special planet types are somewhat unique. But even then the differences are far from significant.
= Many planets, such as toxic, barren or lava worlds can't even be terraformed in the late game.
= Could be fixed by adjusting what sort of resource outputs are given by different classes. Some should give more minerals, others more energy, some more of x or y tech, others biased towards having more space to build but less resources and so on.
+ Species and Phenotype don't affect what traits can be picked, only diplomacy. All of them live for the same number of (base) years, which is 60-70 years. No actual advantages or disadvantages to picking one or another. This means, at the end of the day, what you pick only affects the graphics of a pop you see every time you click on a planet, fleet or whatever unless you're dealing with people who've picked xenophobic ethos.
= Could be tended to by giving certain races unique traits, more or less slots for trait adjustments, different bases ages (possibly with some randomisation) so tree people and turtle people live longer than a human.
+ No trade systems. I mean trade as in trade ships - you can exchange planets, map information, vision, alliances and resources in deals, but you can't exchange the frequently mentioned (by capitalist-style empires) trade agreements.
= Would love to be able to build trade stations and would like to watch trade ships move back and forth, even if they are simply sprites for performance reasons. Come on Paradox! Every damn game has this sort of thing in as a default feature, yet you've left it out.
+ Ship customization is quite limited. Paradox should take note of Star Ruler 2 and their ship customization system. Not asking for that system exactly, but it is a damn good idea and is very well executed.
+ Stale mid to late game. I think they've done a seriously good job at the early game, other than the above problems which only become apparently later in the game and/or through multiple playthroughs. I've got a lot to say as to what could be done, but it is very likely that they have intentionally made these parts stale so to give room for extra $$$ DLC.
= At least if the host owns the DLC, all clients get it. They've confirmed it'll still be the case for this game, so there is that, thank paradox.
+ Feels quite shallow. I'd say it is quite shallow, for I feel it has less in it than EUIV did on release and many others say it has far less than CK2 did, too.			"

281990,76561198013158726,32,40,0,True,25.6,May 11,"Stellaris is another magnificient grand strategy title from Paradox Development Studio that is incredibly deep, immensely detailed and highly ambitious. The game is also championed by a vastly improved user interface when compared with other Paradox games and has a far more inviting learning curve without losing the challenge or depth that the other games by this highly regarded developer offer.
Paradox are widely known for their catalogue of strategy games over the years which are of a very high quality but are also remarkably complex to an extent; some newcomers and even veterans of the genre felt alienated, confused and simply overwhelmed. Stellaris however, has a fully fledged tutorial integrated into the main campaign which not only guides you through the general mechanics along with each feature in a constructive manner; it explains aspects clearly and this is further supported by a far more user friendly interface. The screen is less cluttered when compared with the likes of Europa Universalis IV and all the information is clear, condensed and well presented. 
The game takes place in space which is an almost Call of Duty style departure from the typical Paradox titles of classic eras and a real world setting. The premise is also slightly different as you create your colony from scratch or by selecting some preset examples instead of guiding an already established country. Your goal in the galaxy is to explore, build, research, expand, conquer and even exterminate all other races you come across - basically exactly what you'd expect from a 4X title. You can play this game however you wish and at your own pace -  you may opt to be a fanatic militarist or simply want to discover as much of the universe as possible whilst befriending and benefitting from other races you meet along the way. It is a massively detailed and highly engrossing experience in which the developers have made the transition from reality to sci-fi in a very credible fashion. 
Stellaris runs superbly too and is bolstered by truly fantastic atmosphere enhancing audio that compliments your game throughout. The visuals are very good too and the galaxy map whilst despite looking rather basic, is easy to grasp and understand which is another massive plus. Overall; Stellaris is another superb Paradox title that is riddled with depth and a long term challenge but is also presented and executed in a far more appealling and enjoyable way than some previous titles by the studio. This game will have a bright future and is sure to provide many hours of entertainment.			"

Going strictly by the base game (since no DLC expansions exists as of now):
Stellaris is a terrific Grand Strategy game from Paradox. Difficulty and learning curve are easier than Europa Universalis, though this may change when more DLC comes out. The game is very easy to get into, especially if you're familiar with Paradox games. It's in more of a ""fantasy/sci-fi"" environment than their other stuff, so if you're not into that then I'd avoid this. However, if you want to fight aliens, this game is for you.
Pros:
-Very immersive writing
-Strategy is necessary, not just ship spam
-Different playstyles supported and encouraged
-Both pros and cons to playing tall and wide
-Interesting mechanics that make managing a large empire less ""micro-y"" but still challenging
-Insanely well-developed early game
-Colonizing planets is super fun
-Late game crises make steamrolling impossible
Cons:
-Mid game can get very dull
-After a certain size, scientific research becomes practically pointless
-""Strategic Resources"" don't feel very important, just kind of nice to have
-Sectors lack the depth they demand
-Diplomacy is pretty bland for a Paradox game

It has a promising structure, but at present it's pretty shallow and boring. 
- Diplomacy is pretty bad: barebones options, AI doesn't react to deals they should accept with their eyes closed. War system is terrible (no cb to declare; autosurrender..don't even gert me started)
- AI is very weak. Acts passively, never really a challenge. Allied AI will blob and follow your main fleet regardless of actual strategic situation.
- Planet development is basic at best (seen better systems in 10 year old games), espionage non existent, trade (trade routes-commerce) is absent.
- Battles are very underwhelming. It's a paradox game I know, but really: weapons come with different ranges, but all battles invariably end up in a chaotic melee. No orders, no behaviour, just blob and pray. Very weak. Land battles were better in Moo2, a 20 year old game. 
- The resource gathering and starbase construction is very similar to galciv, it's ok but it gets repetitive. And it's not original.
- Paradox has a strong tradition of ""historical"" games (real world-historic events). Without this context, I feel this game looses a LOT of appeal and originality.

281990,acepilotf14,62,92,3,True,38.9,May 14,"Stellaris is the new game from Paradox, the publisher/developer of such titles as Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Crusader Kings. This review comes from someone with almost 500 hours on EU4, 200 in CK2, and over a thousand in EU3 and Vic2 each (my steam hours are deceiving for those two games).  Now, here are the questions people ask when they first hear about it or want to know about it:
Is it as hard as x Paradox game?
and Is it like civ?
The answers are no and no.
Stellaris is a 4x game cleverly disguised as a grand strategy game.
Exploration: In the opening stages of the game, you explore using science ships your surrounding systems while finding new planets to colonize and encountering events. This is a typical space 4x mechanic and exists in most other games of the genre. Does this compare to other grand strategy games? Not really. Even EU4's 'search' function in the New World is different. How is this distinct from other 4x games? The events are more varied and better written, and have far more interesting fluff. 
Colonizing: Colonization is a very simple 'build colony ship, send ship, wait' mechanic, as is similar to other 4x games. Actual land and building development is like a cross between Civilization 4/5 and Galactic Civilizations 2/3. Every planet has different tiles that you build buildings on (each tile giving different static resources or none at all), and you assign pops (citizens) to work each tile as they grow and spawn on the planet over time based on food surplus or migration from other colonies. This is all very standard 4x. There is not much that makes these features very distinct, and it is done in a very standard way.
Pops: Now comes the first mechanic that is even vaguely grand strategy: pops and how they function. Every pop individually has four things: a species, ethics, happiness, and ethical divergence. Ethics are a feature in Stellaris that begin based on your Empire's 'governing ethics', and vary from spiritualism to materialism to militarism and pacificm. These are the reigning values that determine a great deal about the paths of tech you will go down to how your pops act and how other empires perceive you. Pops begin with these ethics, but they change over time; as generations are want to do. 
Ethics: You can do all sorts of things to encourage or discourage this ethical divergence, and whole populations of your original species may become wholly different from your core populations. This mechanic has the most depth of any mechanic in the entire game. In addition to these ethics, you have a couple other tools available to you if you so wish to reign your empire as they require: slavery and purging. Slavery makes pops work better in manual labor tiles such as farming and mining, but work worse in tiles with research and similar things. Purging is literal genocide or xenocide. Want to Imperium of Man your way and purge all xenos? Go for it. I was proud to see Paradox allow that, as they've been historically wary of slavery or genocide, but I guess aliens are less real than the actual slavery that happened in Africa and America (fu paradox don't revisionist history.). However, even if this has the most depth, it still has less depth than the pop system in Vic2.
Tech: The other entirely unique feature is the tech system. Tech works by drawing from a 'deck' for 3 (or more with modifiers) cards, which you can pick from to start your next research assignment based on three different research paths that operate parallel to one another. After picking the tech you want to research, the other two(+) go back into the deck to be drawn later. This means you may miss out on a tech for a while if you choose to skip it, making important decisions early on even more pressing. This becomes a lot less interesting in the lategame when most techs are already researched and there's a lot of 'repreated' techs that fill up the lists, so I hope more hard decision techs are added later.
FTL: FTL travel has three methods, all three of which are standard 4x tropes. Warp (warp to any system in range, cooldown, warmup, slowish travel time), hyperlanes (can only travel between connected systems, fast, minimal warmup and cooldown) and warp gates (build gates in systems, huge range, very fast, little cooldown, limited by aforementioned built gates). These are very standard and if you've played any other 4x games you know how they work.
War: Warfare is standard as well, and the ship designer is a simple slot-based affair where you stick weapons and modules into a design and it spits out damage and armor values on a generic ship model of which there is only one per class. This will most certainly be expanded in an expansion, though I would have liked to see something more indepth such as Galciv's or Star Ruler 2's systems. It has a few different types of weapons that each are countered by different things. This mostly matters in the early game, because lategame weapons rek everything but aren't quite on the level of really late game galciv things.
Diplomacy: The game does not have very robust diplomacy. I would say it's even slightly below par with other 4x games; and most certainly extremely below par (triple, quad bogey) with grand strategy games. Almost all of your relations have to do with your ethics and government types rather than logical tactical neccessity or events. Embassies are a boring shallow feature when there is nothing you can really do with it. It seems entirely up to the AI who it wants to ally with, and there's not too much you can do to affect that. And if you go militarist; well, good luck finding allies. Additionally, when you do have an ally, you have to declare war together or not at all. Not being able to declare war on my own is an annoying and backwards restriction. I can understand the restriction in the larger federations, but I should not be locked to the wishes of my ally should I want to venture on something myself. You can easily get around this by offering him a planet, but then simply not giving it to him at the end of the war, since apparently the AI just doesn't care. Exploits.
AI: The AI is mediocre or even bad in most cases, though it has that ""perfect micro"" that pdox AI often has where it can snipe things that you would never normally think about just because it can, but when it comes to actually making good decisions it falls on its face. 
Performance: Performance is okay until the lategame when a lot of things are happening, where it hits the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ really fast. Hopefully this is improved in time.
Random Events: My primary complaint is the complete lack of non-surveying events. When you aren't surveying or observing pre-ftl species, there are just very few events that occur randomly and have something to read or think about. This is the sprinkling of grand strat, that even when you're waiting around for things to build, you typically get a steady stream of events to read or do things with, with the occasional big event you really have to deal with or think about. With several of the quest lines being currently broken and the only other long event lines being the end game crises, this is one of the big reasons (as well as the lack of diplomacy as stated above) the midgame is so reportedly BORING. War after war isn't fun, and internal issues are sparse with so few events. We'll certainly hopefully get more with expansions, but that requires them to keep putting more of the grand strat wool over the 4x core rather than submitting to the masses who just want space civ. 
Overall, it's a solid 4x game, and a refreshing take on a genre (space 4x) that has been stagnant for years. Does it beat DW in complexity? Oh, lord no. Does it beat Galciv in raw gameplay? Not really. Does it beat other grand strats in flavor and atmosphere? No.
So what is it? A pretty good 4x game, but a terrible grand strategy game. Maybe it'll be a proper one someday, but not now.

The game runs super stable, I haven't had a single crash after many hours, performance is also good, for me anyway. Even multiplayer is absolutely stable without desyncs! The game has great potential in it's design.
contra:
In all other aspects I would consider this game to be in an early beta stage,You'll find lots of significant bugs, completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, infuriating UI that leaves you blind and many features that are completely underdeveloped or not well thought out.
They merely laid the groundwork, in many ways very well with good ideas I would say. but they didn't flesh anything out. Wargoals for example, you have only 3 options, take planets, vassalize or liberate planets, in many situations none of these make much sense, and there are so many more possible wargoals that could easily be implemented with the depth the game potentially offers. It's like they made a ""proof of concept"" to show that it works and then just couldn't be bothered to actually do it properly. This to me defines this entire game, it's simply far from finished, but with great potential.
So right now I would recommend you wait at least a few months before you check in again to see if it's in a release worthy state.			"
281990,76561198030616471,39,53,3,True,215.7,May 9,"This may well be the best space strategy game I have ever played.
Basically, you take Distant Worlds Universe; take out the annoying features; improve the graphics and accessibility; and add the modding that i would like to have seen in Distant Worlds. And there you have Stellaris: superior to Distant Worlds in almost every respect, except perhaps the private fleet (which may well be moddable).
What makes this game really awesome is the moddability. Don't like the decisions made by the designers? Redesign the game to your own liking. Want to play in the Milky Way galaxy? make your own galaxy (or wait for someone else to make it). 
Stellaris as released is a very enjoyably game, and I would recommend it even without the moddability. But Stellaris is so much more than that: it is essentially a tool for creating a space game that plays exactly the way you want it to. It doesn't get much better than that!			"
281990,76561198034974662,96,151,4,False,71.0,May 15,"The early game where you are slowly unveiling the galaxy for the first time is enjoyable. You're discovering what the game has to offer and thinking ahead about space you want to control. Who will be your allies and enemies?
There are problems later in the game, unfortunately. For example, the war system is nonsense. When war begins you are restricted to choosing roughly 3-5 planets that you will take from the enemy (there is a 100 point cost system for your war plan). During the war you can destroy all their armies and land troops onto every one of their worlds, but in the end you can only accept the 3-5 planets you declared initially.
This means that you have to declare war multiple times against an enemy to eliminate them. When a war ends you enter a period of peace (a long period) which you must wait to expire before war can be declared again. This is simply tedium because you've already destroyed their army and scooped valuable planets out of their empire.
Worse, if you are in a federation (which is how I chose to play) then you can only declare war every 40 or 50 years or so (which is probably a few hours of play, though I have not run a stopwatch on it). During the periods you cannot declare war you're twiddling your thumbs hoping the current federation president accidentally declares the war you want, or that your enemies declare a war against you (though the AI is not likely to declare a war against your superior empire). The system is incompetent.
There are numerous bugbears throughout the game that suggest development ended prematurely. For example, you're forced to yield control of planets to the AI, but this AI neglects your citizen's basic need of happiness, giving rise to rebellions (what this game calls ""factions"").
The UI is sometimes obtuse and on occasion wildly misleading. You will make several mistakes on this basis. For example, the game mislead me to colonise planets with the wrong species, resulting in them being miserable and rebellious. On top of this, the game offers poor or no solutions to correct the problem. These planets I made mistakes on are likely to be permanently doomed. My only out is to become evil and purge (kill) them, but this would be suicide due to the political ramifications.
I hope they can improve and polish these systems with further iterations of this game (patches, DLC, expansions, whatever). In the meantime I think you're better off playing a 4x game that is more mature.			"
281990,76561198011769842,86,135,6,True,35.4,May 25,"My favourite part of Stellaris are the emergent stories that arise. Like the time I uplifted my first race, and their initial act as part of the wider galactic universe was to send their very first star fighter to join my dozens currently engaged in an ongoing war. I was never more proud.
Or the time one of my observation crews was caught descending to a primitive planet and worshipped as a god, complete with pyramids. Needless to say, they were swiftly fired. Then there was the hubris I displayed reactivating an ancient alien device found on a newly colonized planet, only to have it awaken terrible beasts that devoured my colonists. Stellaris is not only my favourite Grand Strategy game, but easily the most fun Iâ€™ve had building a galactic empire and exploring the stars.
Stellaris captures the craziness and fun of sci-fi in an engaging, infinitely replayable strategy game.			"
281990,deliciousbrown,61,92,0,False,120.8,June 2,"The thumbs down is only for the game at the moment of my last played game (5/29/2016)(Pre-Clark Update) this does not mean the game won't get better with time as it most likely will if it follows the usual paradox dlc strategy. (The review will be updated in a years time after the 1st dlc arrives) After playing for a little over a hundred hours I think I've seen enough to give a fair opinion. The game is a bare bones 4x(if you can even call it that). 
+A variety of special events and lore activities like the ones in CK2 and EU4
+Looks beautiful especially the space battles best looking paradox game to date! 
+Nothing more satisfying than looking at that cool ARC emitter you spent years researching blasting the face off of that that enemy battle ship at long range. 
And that there is pretty much where the praises end:
-Diplomacy is so lacking it's pathetic and there's only 2 war options liberate and cede planet.
-AI is bad all around especially when it comes to sectors.
-Sectors are just a black hole where you dump planets and forget about them. They have NO events to speak of.
-Needs more events! You'll see some events more than a dozen times throughout a single game. 
-Lot's of broken events (Pre Clark Update). I've had an asteroid impact event in my game for well over 200 years after I had already destroyed the thing.
-Only 3 late game crisis and their all horde mode. Horde's that the other AI empires wouldn't even attack(Pre-Clark Patch). You would be the only empire in the galaxy fighting against absolute doomsday and everybody else just sits around declaring war on other AI empires or doing nothing.
-NO ECONOMY so bad it's almost a joke. Trade is done pretty half ♥♥♥♥♥ but you can expect either paradox to add it in as a free update or charge you money for it in dlc form.
---ADVERTISED AS A 4X GAME YET IT'S MORE LIKE 3X! The devs are actively trying to limit expansion for their own reasons. Beware of this fact if you like expanding fast in your strategy games.
-Mid to late game will get ULTRA boring at times since it take's forever to research tech if your a big empire and there's really not too many events left at that point. 
-Lagging in mid to late game
-Who's bright idea is it to keep shoving unneeded EU4 land based mechanics into a ""4x"" space game? It doesn't work well in a space setting. 
Again all of this was before the Clark update and I know quite a bit was changed I'm writing this late review for when I finished my last play though off it. The biggest thing that stuck out to me was that instead of fixing  things in the game like lag, events, and sectors they instead focused on nerfing and hindering player strategies to force them to play the game paradox invisioned it to be played instead of letting players do their own thing.
At this moment the game is beautiful but half ♥♥♥♥♥ in many places and made bare bones so they can sell dlc later on to patch it up. Something I don't take to to kindly too.

281990,edgarallanpro,222,372,12,False,49.7,May 12,"So disappointing.
The AI cheats - you can't for instance make them run out of energy. Even a single planet without any stations can support an infinitely large fleet, which isn't fun if your fleets are the same size + they have a spaceport.
War declarations are stupid in this game. You can only declare on planets they have settled, which are very often not the ones you want. You want ones that suit your race. But you can't declare for an unsettled system. You have to take a system that they have settled, even if you don't want it.
Combat's pretty bad. The AI is exploitably stupid. send a single warship from the other direction, their fleet leaves the planet, you can wipe out the spaceport and then the fleet separately. Which is the only way I've found of beating cheating AIs - see above. You also can't tell your ships - hey stay inside the aura of this defense station - it's actually what's going to win this fight. Or to retreat without leaving the system. I just wanted them to back up a bit - why get in range of the stations if you don't have to?
As for the RPS system of lasers/shields etc. That's great and all. But in order to find out what your opponent uses... you need to invade. Hooray. No espionage in the game, nor are they likely to venture into range of your scanners with their fleet. Good luck building that fleet after your war dec.
Forget getting the AI to make a deal either. Seems like even just to trade charts you'll need to send them more than a far share to get a deal passed. The diplomacy of EU4 is gone. Replaced with the braindead ""why is this even in the game"" diplomacy of Civ5:BE. It also happens between two screens you'll need to keep changing between endlessly. Yeah, embassies and alliances happen in this screen, but trades and pacts happen in this other screen. No you can't exchange for systems that aren't settled (i.e. useful ones) and if you could, I don't doubt the AI would never agree. There's simply no tools to handle relations with other relations, nor are there the nice and transparent summary screens of EU4. You get embassies and rivals. That's never enough.
And the ♥♥♥♥ing primitive planets. There's no way for a xenophobic race to deal with them. I just want them gone. But no diplomacy with them to wage war against them... ♥♥♥♥. You have four ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options, and they become a ticking time bomb. If they become a vassal they instantly take all the nearby systems with them. Even if the system they were in had a frontier station. Great - guess I'll wage war against them in ... 10 years. Even if the race is some screwed up ""kill all other species"" race. No Paradox, I get to kill them now.
Also, there seems to be no way of ignoring peace deals. I'm waging war just to destroy all life on their planets, and they end up giving them to me... I don't want that. I declared war to empty their planets, so I can move in. If I'm not a race that can purge - what is my recourse then? You can't deal with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ planets of other races - the tools for integration amount to an endless spending of your points to keep a faction happy. And slaves suck. Oh boy do they suck. 50% production? What? So they can starve?
Also, the tech drafting can ruin your game. You want to colonise? Guess it hasn't come up yet. You need bigger ships or better weapons because yours are out of date? Screw you, research one of these instead.
I don't really want to play this game anymore. Frankly. I appreciate some of the grind has been taken away from games like MoO, of managing planets and so on. But that comes back the moment building stations on multiple systems becomes tedious. It's also all the game really is. Exploration. Expansion dies off so quickly, there's no reason to fight other civs, because what you'll get you won't want. Stellaris is a 1X game at best. Because the other 3X's it falls down at, so hard. It's not grand strategy either. Not in the slightest.
If there was a faster speed than fastest I certainly would have been using it. In the end it's just as shallow as the new MoO is. Event chains certainly don't save it.
These are fundamental problems, and maybe DLC will fix them (cynically I think that may have been paradox's plan from day one) but it will be a long time coming.			"
281990,zyffer,22,25,2,True,126.5,May 9,"This game is wonderful!  Firstly, creating your own custom race and empire is one of the best parts of the game.  You choose everything from what type of species you are, what sort of planet you came from, your ethics and government, visuals, and starting weapon systems (guns, missles, or lasers), and even method of FTL travel.
     There are 3 options.  Standard warp, slow but non-restrictive, hyperspace, fast but dependent on naturally occuring hyperspace ""lanes"" or Wormhole gates, instant travel to or from a system within range of a warpgate. One of the more unique choices i've seen in a space 4x game.  The game even reacts quite well to your choices when it comes to your empire's ethics and government types.  Dialogue boxes will change to reflect your empires outlook on alien lifeforms and the cosmos in general.
     You start off just after your first FTL capable ships are created and the whole galaxy is a mystery, your first task is scanning all the objects in your home system that until now your species as only gazed at through telescopes.  You'll find strange anomolies that spawn research projects and discover wonderous new worlds.  The early game perfectly captures the feeling of curiosity and exploration.  As you progress you may encounter primitive civilizations that you can subjagate or silently observe in the hopes of one day uplifting them.  You'll obviously also encounter other empires with which you must either befriend or make your foe.
     The war system on this game is also quite unique, at the start of a war you declare what you want to get out of it.  If you are scary enough you might be able to get them to just give you a planet to avoid a war.  If a war does start the game keeps track of battles won and lost and give you a war score that will affect how much you can demand at the peace talks should you choose to negotiate an end to the hostilities.  The better your score the more likely you are to get a favorably lopsided peace deal.  
     Being that the game only released today i have not gotten much father than my first real war with another empire, which I won and I forced him to become my vassal.  But it is amazing how many options you have to deal with other empires.   You can create an embassy which will slowly make them like you over time or declare them a rival which makes them dislike you greatly but you gain influence points which you spend on things like frontier outposts to expand your borders or on Edicts (essentially passive bonuses to your empire that cost continual influence upkeep).
     Graphically the game is gorgeous.  I often find myself just roaming my systems staring at the strange or beatiful worlds I encounter.
     All in all if you are a Sci-fi fan, or a fan of 4x games your gonna wanna check this out.  If you like Sci-fi AND 4X games this game is a MUST HAVE.
     If your new to the 4X genre the game might be a bit overwhelming as there can be a lot of micromanaging.  However the game has a great tutorial system that explains the game as you go without getting in the way too much.  Also there are a few ways to automate management on certain things if you hate micromanagement.
     I'm not sure if I've played it enough to give it a X/10 number yet but I played it non-stop since release today and never felt bored or frustrated.  It has excellent pacing and is the most enjoyable 4x game i've played in a while.  It does a great job of making the galaxy feel vibrant and alive.  Honestly I can't recommend this game enough.

Jokes aside, for those who have played about 30 minutes and are ready to give up: I know the UI is almost impossible at the beginning, it's because Stellaris is unlike many 4x Space Strategy games in the same genre. Take your time, learn how to play it and what makes it unique compared to the other 4x's games out there. You won't regret it, you'll be glad you learned this new take on the genre.
For those who are having a buggy launch: Give it time, don't refund it yet as this may be a game you end up enjoying if the problems are solved.
For those who think this is the best game ever: After 9.5 hours of straight Stellaris goodness, I can safely say, somethings are being exaggerated. This game is damn good and leaves room for plenty of additional content in the future but it's not the best 4x Strategy game ever. It does a lot good but it mostly does things that have already been done in a new way so it's more of refreshing perspective than it is a genre defining masterpiece.
For those on the fence: Take the plunge, unless you're having a buggy launch, you can't go wrong. Look at the treatment other Paradox games get, there will be more content to go with this already sizeable game.			"

I will put a negative review for the moment, concerning (at least for me) this problem/issue.
Ok...what the is the point of a ""peace"" faction? What did the developers have in mind, regarding them? 
Domination and Concuest victories is the only ones available. 
And Fedrations whilst you are united, doesn't add anything at all to the progress.One ally and my vassals would have been enuf anyway.
So what should I do ? What do they want me to do? 
Yea well ok. I understand you would gain a lot of planets that way as a federation. But the AI can create Federations too so.
Should I just vassalize everyone and integrate them at a huge price? 
As a pacifist nation I really don't want a -10 or -20% happiness penalty all the time.
But that's not all. The pacifist food bonus is mediocre and only helps you very early in the game. 
A peaceful nation has no point really. Nor a Federation, at least as a pacifist nation.
I don't know how I feel about this, the game is basically limiting itself to one way of playing.

281990,lyndonguitar,25,32,0,True,117.0,May 12,"TL;DR: Get the game. You wouldn't even be here reading reviews if you don't like space 4x games, and this is a great 4x game
Galaxy and FactionsFirst of all you start in a galaxy of a maximum of 1000 stars(there are mods to play even more stars). planets/asteroids,etc are in orbit around stars, which adds a nice immersion, Factions are randomly generated every game, instead of the same old prebuilt factions that you have in other 4x games, although you can build your own factions to spawn in the galaxy if you wish do to so. and there's lots and lots of different variable options so that you basically will never meet the same faction twice, huge number of government types, ideas, culture, races, ship types, FTL types, etc. Faction customization is great, It's like every possible faction personality is available to create. you can even customize the random names the factions give to their people, ships, fleets, armies, planets, stars, etc.
Tons of events are happening in the galaxy as well, giving it more personality and flavor, sometimes the game gives you quest-like missions where you have to study this wreckage, then it will lead to another points of interests, leading to new techs, bonuses, etc.
Empire/GovernmentEmpire management is awesome, you can actually select your type of government(and change it in-game) resulting in different types of bonuses and government systems. You can have a democracy where there's an election every 5 years, 50 years, or a dictatorship, empire, religion-based faction, science-lead faction, etc, etc. Each elected leader has different personalities as well, with different aims, platforms, etc. Some ruler will want to bring back slavery to your empire when elected for example. Rulers are picked from a pool of leaders, basically your admirals, generals, researchers, and governors in your empire, and they have different agendas if they get elected as leader, Support the one you like the most. Factions can also form up inside your empire if your population's culture and beliefs become more and more varied. Some people may like the current government, some people may want changes or reforms.
The population system is also well-made. You can actually play as a non-genocidal xenophilic type, where every race(or certain races only, it's up to you) is welcome to your empire. again, unlike other 4x games where it's you or them. You can have an empire composing of many different races, and they can have different privileges, like giving them rights to vote, to move freely, etc. You can be as racist as you like or as welcoming as you like. or both! welcome them, and then exterminate them! Your choice. You can even genetically manipulate your own species, or other races, or create robots, androids, or genetically enhanced soldiers, some races might be better soldiers than others, use them as such.
DiplomacySome would say the diplomacy is lacking compared to other games, but I beg to differ. There's lots of things to do in the diplomacy side. First of all, FEDERATIONS, you can actually form federations with different factions, not just alliances, but federations, you elect a federation president every few years and rotate around the different members, the federation also has their own shared federation fleet, comprising of technology taken from all the members. It's similar to GalCiv's United Planets but you aren't forced to join and it's not automatically created for everyone, even enemy factions. Lots of different treaties like star chart sharing, non-aggression treaties, embassies, research ventures, and good ol' resource trading. There's no traditional 'trade lines' trading like in galciv though. You can make a faction your vassal, and there are multiple types, you can even play as vassal to another empire and eventually liberate yourself from it if you want to. you can also integrate them into your empire.
One more awesome thing is you can actually see primitive civilizations in game!, and they all vary and you can see them in different states, whether they are in the early space age, bronze age, industrial, etc. or you might even see a dead world where a past civilization blew themselves up due to nuclear war. If you are playing as non-humans, you might even see our own Solar System!, maybe we blew ourselves up? maybe you just arrived in time before we do? or you arrived during our cavemen days and chose to observe us instead? You can observe them, advance their technology, abduct them for experiments or even uplift them, or invade and exterminate them.
ResourcesResources system is well made, you mine minerals from planets, asteroids, either from orbit, or if you have the planet colonized, on the ground. You need minerals basically for everything that you construct. You can construct power plants, in lots of different ways in order to get Energy Credits, which is the main currency of the game. You also have three research resources: Society, Engineering and Physics, and different celestial bodies give bonuses to them when an orbital station or facility is constructed. You also gain influence points to use on diplomacy or actions related to your empire/faction/government.
Research and TechnologyYou also can have three researches going on in parallel, which is Society, Engineering and Physics, which is much more immersive as well. no more having to decide whether to research for your colony infrastructure first or for your military strength, etc. Technology is smartly randomized every time you finish a research, meaning, there is no fixed research tree, you get the immersion of really researching stuff, as you won't know what technology lies far ahead.
WarfareSpace Warfare is similar to your usual Space RTS games, with the good addition of Turn Based like status reports, where you can see statistics of the battle while it is going on, there is also land warfare in which you can create and recruit armies and invade planets to finally colonize them, you can also get air support from your ships in orbit and bombard the planet however way you want.
Thoughts about the gameGreat game, huge great potential to become one of the best space 4x games ever made after more content is made(DLCs, expansions) I'm not saying it's lacking content though, it's got more than enough to keep you playing. My expectations on this game was not that high considering all other recent 4X games have been 'meh' for me, and I haven't really played any Paradox Interactive games that much. It's already better than most if not all other 4x games out there, and it's only going to get better with time.
Score: 9.5/10
As of writing this, it's 94% positive right now on steam reviews. worth the price.			"

It's got one of the best nation/race creation systems since Stars!, unique races that are different every game.
 It's got a anomalies/events system that is far more expansive than i realised, quest lines to discover precursor race homeworlds and unique techs, lots of star trek like stuff including finding primitive races. You can be entertained for hours without even interacting with the other alien races.
It's pretty as well, everything looks sharp, the icons and alien race portraits are all well drawn and distinct. I'd go on but i want to get back to playing the game.

So I was a little bit hesitated about getting Stellaris.
But after reading some good postive reviews I finaly decide to jump on the train and see 
what's it all about.
It's suprisely very approachable even if you never really played games like Stellaris.
The game is pretty in depth and the combat is fun.
I always been much of a multiplayer guy , so I really love how the game packs out during multiplayer.
Some people turn their backs against humanity , while others seek alliances. 
Sure there are a few issues with the game which I am sure Paradox is working on it.
Issues like joining multiplayer games , some ingame mechanics tweaks ( sectors front posts don't drawn influence etc)
Overall I do recommend this game for anyone out there looking for a new addiction.

281990,76561198047769062,37,54,2,True,40.4,May 14,"My thoughts after having just played from Earth to overwhemingly defeating a Fallen Empire.
It is a good game. I didn't stay up till 6am playing it for nothing. The start is really well thought out and you genuinely feel like a species reaching out into the unknown. The anomalies are great and the randomness of techs means you will start out differently each time. 
I do have to agree with the mid game complaints though. The problem is that sectors are in no way comparable to playing as a King with a bunch of unruly Dukes to manage. Sectors are too simple. Basically you can add infinite planets to a sector and everything just works. Those areas become effective dead zones on the field. When your empire is growing, and the number of empires in the world is diminishing, internal politics is what would normally offset that decrease in activity. I fully expect this will be addressed in later expansions but it does feel a bit slow grinding up your ship count and having nothing internal happening to occupy you. Thinking of CK2, I consider the empire building and internal power struggles to be the mid game and it's something we don't have here yet.
Some of the ship AI isn't great. I had 1000 (the max) ships attacking and they arranged themselves into a column so only 100 could shoot at any time. Pretty frustrating as there was no opportunity to change it. Fortunately the enemy did the same but it took away from the immersion somewhat.
Overall I think this game is a whole lot of potential built on some solid foundations. It feels a bit weak in the diplomacy compared to Paradox' less experimental games. I'd also like to see better ship management, maybe using a 3D or layered 2D battlefield to really resolve those collision issues. End game could possibly benefit from some 'supertechs' as I was mostly just getting +5% modifiers to research.
Really fun though and I look forward to it getting the true Paradox treatment over the next few years!			"

281990,76561198090686152,322,559,24,False,48.0,May 10,"I really enjoy this game, but I'm one of the people that always checks negative reviews to better understand what I'm getting into so here goes.
Stellaris is a great starting point to an amazing 4x space game. It is made to be mod friendly, and it shows in base gameplay. You can mod in your own races, change starting conditions of the galaxy, and just about anything you can imagine. However, it also seems that it will be up to the mods to really take this game to the next level in the vanilla version.
So what holds this game back? I would say the scale of what this game WILL be actually hurts the fun of the vanilla game at launch. The diplomacy is simple. ""I like you, no war"" or ""Ooh, planet. Declare war out of nowhere."" The planet screens remind me a lot of MoO or, more accurately, Sid Meier's Colonization town screens. You move your pops, create buildings to increase resource output, and generally try to min/max your tiles. However, 22 years is a long time to leave a concept nearly the same. 
Combat, oh combat. If you are coming from EU4/CK2 then combat will probably be a step up. You can customize your ships (a la every 4x space game now), and group them in fleets to attack. However, actual combat is just moving stacks onto eachother, as in EU4. The feedback is fairly minimal, but DOES provide the info to know what major adjustments to your ships you need to make. Minor details about which modules are effective would be helpful.
So overall opinion: I'm enjoying it. I will spend this week making the galaxy Trump again. However, if you are expecting anything near the polish of EU4, remember what EU4 was like on launch. The DLC and patches for this game will be what really determines how great this game is.
Edit: For clarity, the reason it is not recommended is because this is NOT at the same level of polish and complexity as other Paradox games RIGHT NOW. If you are looking for that, wait a little while. However, for the price, I would still recommend it by itself and I fully believe it will end up surpassing my hours on EU4 (556 and counting) as the free patches and DLC expand the gameplay.
Edit 2 for more clarity: If you are someone who loves the depth and complexity of EU4/CK2, I recommend you wait for some more content to be added. So it's more of a conditional ""don't recommend."" 
Thanks for all the feedback!			"

281990,fucking_hacker,51,79,9,True,39.1,May 13,"I have not done a review in a while so bare with me. So this game is perfect if you're a 4X or a Grand Strategy fan, because this game is a mix between the two, and I highly recommend this game, and besides, it's pricetag is not the usual $60, but it's actually $40. I'm not very good at explaining games, but I'll give you a little fun story from the game.
So my science ship was surveying this system and, as it turns out, there was an industrial-age era civilization on one of the planets. This was perfect, since I already colonized a planet on a nearby system, so this planet is in my borders. These guys were the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n civilization. I decided to send a construction ship there and build an observation post there so the my scinetists can passively study them. 
Fast-forward 10 years, and I'm in the middle of a war with a neighbor who was a xenophobic fanatic spiritualist, so they basically hate me since my empire is fanatic materialist, the opposite of spiritulist. Anyway, right after a huge battle where half of my ships were destroyed, I get an event of a level 4 class asteroid headed towards the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n planet. Normally, I would've sent my ships to destroy the asteroid, but my ships were heavily damaged and there was an enemy navy in a system right next to my home system, so I couldn't just go there and destroy it, because then the enemy would attack the capital. Basically, I watched the asteroid slowly encroach on the doomed planet, and the beautiful, jungle planet became a desolate, barren planet, and also got some rings now, like Saturn's rings.
I just watched an entire civilization disappear like that in front of my eyes and I didn't even do anything. For a few minutes, I felt bad for them. But hey, that's Stellaris, and maybe you'll get an awesome story to tell someone someday.			"

Granted it has a lot of flaws, however Paradox have been communicating with people who have bought they game and have been keeping an eye on the Stellaris Subreddit to see what bugs and problems people find with the game. They have already laid out a plan of patches to arrive towards the end of May and through June that will be focusing on the main problems with the game: Diplomacy and AI, whilst also fixing some major bugs and adding some more things in for QoL. 
If you're a fan of Sci Fi and of games like Civ, Pax Imperia or Master of Orion, I am sure you will enjoy this. 
Plus, the ability to create your favourite race from a video game (to the best of your ability) and then roleplay as them is really what makes this game great. I mean who doesn't want to create the Imperium of Man from 40k and then proceed to extinguish all alien life in the galaxy for being filthy Xenos? Hell, be space hippies for all i care, just buy the damn game, and I assure you, you won't regret it.

281990,76561198093807102,145,247,3,False,41.4,May 20,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with a lot of the other negative reviews on here. It doesn't feel finished. The game in its current form just doesn't deserve a recommendation, no matter how much I want to give it one. 
To rehash what others have said, the early game is a ton of fun. Your race sets out into the stars, bright-eyed and full of wonder at the vastness of the galaxy. You explore, eagerly finding new anomalies scattered amongst the stars. You find asteroids and planets scattered in the darkness. Eventually, you see a habitable world and with your scientists' valiant contributions, create a colony ship to take your people into a new era. The first weird space faring creatures you see are wonderful and are quickly researched to find out more about them. The first alien race you encounter is a great moment, full of excitement. Then more and more races appear until the galaxy is brimming with life! Then it stops. Nothing happens from this point on. You slowly research technology (very slowly). Spread onto a few new worlds in your territory as your tech progresses. But the universe stops reacting and gives you very few things to do other than try to conquer your neighbour out of boredom.
Later game, a certain event happened in my game that seems like it should be huge. A truly alien danger appears and threatens to overwhelm the entire galaxy. Then it stops too. It sits in its territory doing nothing for literally hundreds of years. As I'd been a wonderful, peace loving race with a very small navy before this, I was sure I would have to battle for my very survival. But nope, just sat in my territory slowly building a massive death fleet with advanced weaponry that wiped out the so called galactic threat system by system through slow chipping away.
All in all, I don't regret buying it, I got a few hours of fun out of it. And I'm sure that Paradox will do their usual thing and turn this into an amazing game in the future. It isn't there yet though, so it is going back into the library for now until the rest of the game comes along.
I'd save your money until that amazing game is actually finished.			"

281990,76561198026838635,38,57,2,False,19.5,May 29,"Even if the genre isn't exactly the same, I like comparing this game to Civ 5.
The idea is that you should strive for the stars either diplomatically or martially, so that you more or less become the ruler of the galaxy. Therefore, you do the 4x'es: Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate. You build buildings on your planets, you can terraform them, you can build stations around planets that gather resources or give research points, you can trade or you can go to war, either as the lone wolf or in an alliance.
Sounds great, doesn't it?
It does. But the problem is the 5th X: The Xecution. Trading is even worse than in Civ 5 where you had trade routes AND instant trade: Here, you don't have trade routes at all. If you remember the ♥♥♥♥-poor trade menu in Civ 5 with the tiny lines you had to click on and thought it was the worst system possible: Think again. Here, you have a similar list structure, that is bigger, but you have to switch tabs between offerings and demands. Also, the AI sometimes doesn't even accept presents, depite being ""friendly"". However, the AI does only do something when it is sure it will be accepted. So the AI builds alliances at staggering speeds, while you have to check every in-game month whether any of the AI would accept an alliance invite. Diplomacy? Feel free to estabish vastly overpowered embassies, ameliorating the standing with the other faction - until you run of of them, as you can maximally have 4 embassies.
Also, remember setting your scout to explore mode in civ 5 and never ever having to manage them again until they either get to the coast or the whole map was explored? Well, be excited by this immersive gameplay decision Stellaris has made: Get ready to manage every very single system survey by hand. Automatic exploration? Nope.
Same goes for contruction ships (the workers in Civ 5). Automation? Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. It's even more tedious as your faction's borders expand with time and planets that you couldn't previously mine become available. So if you have a Chile-Style empire (long and narrow), get ready to check all few years whether you can exploit more systems.
Reaseach is similar: Get ready to select research targets from 3 different sections (Society, Science and Engineering), which is fun until you run out of Scientists and you get a 20% malus on the research speed. The scientists themselves are Leaders: Guys you need to buy for influence because... ? Civ 5 had a similar thing by being able to buy prophets and stuff for faith points, but they were more or less optional. In Stellaris you don't get anywhere without research.
So far, we've established that the diplomacy lacks practically everything needed to be able to be a valuable way to go. Alright. Not what I would have hoped for in a strategy game like this. But then again, war can be entertaining as well, right?
Aaaand nope. It all boils down to the simple rule: Steamroll everything or get steamrolled. Remember in Civ 5, when you were furios about the tremendous defense strength a city had, making it nearly impossible to conquer a city until you had catapults? Well, this time, your planets are about the weakest things in the game. Sure, they can't be conquered in the first few minutes, but as your empire grows, it becomes impossible to defend every single planet. Big fleets are far better, even for defense, which is weird at best.
Alliances do a ♥♥♥♥ job of defending you btw, and the (thankfully disablable) empires starting with an advantage either love you or hate you from the first contact and then will steamroll you to death or leave you be. Seriously. You don't even have to give them a reason to attack you. They just do (similar to civ 5). The only problem then is: The AI does only do things when they are sure they can pull it off. So if they declare war and you're in ironman mode, exit the game and start a new one or give them half your empire, just so they can attack you again after the peace period runs out. It basically always is gg.
About the shipdesigning: Well, you design ships. Is cool, but as your fleets will be a blob anyways and you can't see what's going on in fights, you basically just change some stat values.
I personally didn't find the UI too confusing, but I can understand why some do: Too many tabs, too many hidden options and too much scrolling to do without clear indicators that you CAN scroll.
In the end, I'd consider it as a realtime CIV 5 in space without the hidious round times (as it is an RTS), but with every single contra civ 5 had (Really, it seems to me that Paradox had a checklist of all the bad things about CIV 5 to tick) and none of the pros of balance, trading and automations.
I'd say: Pick it up when it's cheaper than 20 bucks, maybe even as a package with the promised DLCs (that should have been in the basegame...) so you get the game it should have been.
Don't buy this barebone for 40 bucks.
TL:DR:
Buy it if you LOVED all things that were flawed in CIV 5, don't buy it if you didn't LOVE civ 5. (Liking doesn't seem sufficient to me).			"

It has some interesting things to say about the 4x model and correctly approaches the many pitfalls that other games just like it have failed at.  In the end it also has a good price-point, which talks to me about the thought put into addressing it's audience.
O.K.  The good, the bad and the ugly:
Good: It has intricate depth to almost all aspects of the game.  Once you think you have figured something out, you quickly find out that there is much much more.  The sound track is REALLY good.  The AI does not simply focus on KILL KILL KILL. They act appropriate to their civ traits and tech levels (shocker).  It's really a very pretty game.
Bad:  The AI that ""auto-designs"" your space fleet is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and, until I figured out what was going on, I lost like 4 or 5 games to crazy inferior civs because of it.  The UI needs some tweeking (for example: there are moons that you need to click on sometimes that are so small that you have to barely adjust your mouse this way or that in order to click it... very dumb).  The tutorial for the game does a farely decent job at addressing the basics like what one interface or another is for, but does nothing for others.  Additionally, there are entire aspects of the game that could use SOME sort of information, but has none to offer.  In some way this lends to an atmosphere of mystery, but some people would just call this poor game design.
The inbetween:  The tech tree is non-existant.  In lue of this basic 4x concept the game uses a new and interesting mechanic that the game designers call a sort of semi-random lottery.  You draw 3 random techs from the pool of possible techs every time you start a new game or finish researching a technology.  It's really interesting to be sure, but semi-frustrating because I have no idea what the technologies are that are possible.  My initial frustration was that I couldn't make a plan... like in CIV 5 for example.  In Civ 5 I look at the tech tree and look at what resources are available and make a plan that involves my ersearch path and the units I build to take advantage of available materials around my cities.  After playin about 15 games now I can tell you that I really like the way Stellaris does this.  I'm sure that the developers looked at this and called it a risk, but in the end I think it's something unique... a risk in game design that has payed off.
The ugly:  Fleet battles in Stellaris are sure pretty, but unlike a game like Sins of a Solar Empire that absolutely hit the concept of ""Fleet Battles"" out of the ♥♥♥♥ing park home-run style... Stellaris really just failed.  Once a battle begins you have NO ♥♥♥♥ing control over it what-so-♥♥♥♥ing-ever.  You can't, for example, force a singular ship that is being focused by the other fleet to retreat.  There is only one ♥♥♥♥ing thing you can ♥♥♥♥-all do once combat begins: force the entire fleet to retreat... and oddly enough there is a random trait that fleet leaders can develop after retreating that disable even that small piece of control. SO. ♥♥♥♥ING. FRUSTRATING.
So all that said I think that if you like games like CIV 5, Gal Civ, Sins or any 4x like that, then you should certainly check this game out.  I'm still having a lot of fun with it.			"

281990,76561197965769436,41,63,2,False,30.4,May 11,"I loved playing this game in the early stages. Resources were scarce and i felt compelled to move out into the galaxy (get more energy, always more energy)
I did probably start with a galaxy that was to big (800 systems and alot of ai races) This meant i had quite a bit of growing to do before i hit the borders of another faction (so no need to fight or compete with anyone else early) 
The different races also prefer different planets wich is cool, but kinda kept the competition low since i was one of the only races who went for continental planets.
Anyway i got to the mid game without any problems, with only a few races ahed of me in power/tech. 
I had a nice big empire around 15planets and all the resources i could need, and here lies the problem.. Since i have all that i need to reserch new tech, feed my navies and so forth, what reason do i have to go to war? Or trade? 
None :p There is absolutley nothing to do.... 
Ive been in two wars sofar! 
With the first being initiated by me on this bird race who hated me from the start, those xenophobic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. 
They were ahed of me in fleet size and fleet tech. No need to worry, i got my ally involved and he helped me make a bigger blob of ships equal to 10k power, vs the enemy 6k. 
Needless to say the war lasted for 1battle and a few planetary assults. 
Since their navy was dead there was no opposition and i was just running around with transports(boring)
Eventually another empire decleared war on them sensing weakness and the cowardly birds sued for peace. Now this was a big(ish) empire but i could instantly make them a vassal + release part of their empire, who later joined my alliance..
The second war was initiated by my ally vs another xenophobic reptilian race who had rivaled both of us and had a big border vs my ally.
Again my ally sent their entire fleet to me so to make the biggest blorg (blob) and whack the enemy fleet out of the game in 2battles (fun right?)
Now here i have two gripes: 
1: Why do i need to lead the ai fleets around?? I had NO stake in that war and only wanted to give token support to my ally.. But he refused to do ANYTHING on his own :p I tried parking my fleet around my homeworld and he just sat there while the enemy burned his worlds. 
Finally i caved and sent our blob of death to the enemy homeworld. That got his intention and he sent his fleet to defend.. This was the only reason i went deep into his empire, I wanted to face his fleet and autowin the war (fun right?) The battle system in crusader kings have more depth then this!! 
Im sorry to say: The combat, it just sucks.... :o 
I cant describe the lack of satisfaction in fighting wars like this :(
1: The game lacks depth, plain and simple.. I am used to more from paradox and i dont know why they went in this direction
2: You can probably optimise your empire way better then i did.. 
But why care? When i got everything i needed by uppgrading powerplans/mines. Maybe its different on smaller maps? Then again, i diddentt want to play smaller maps :p
3: Diplomacy and trade: Its lacking depth, its lacking function (as in: i need x from you, here take my y) Ive had very little meaningfull trade deals (research deals being one) Just to give one example: The ai i made into a vassall hate me. They are disloyal, and still when the second war came, they were there fighting by my side with the few ships they had managed to rebuild :p 
They hate me, but has no problems dying for me?
Alliances are meaningfull i guess, and i havent tried federation yet.
4: Resources: There are special resources that can be used to improve certain things: happiness, better powerplant, weapons and whatnot, but i never feel like a need them! My needs are already met within my empire.
5: Population: I dont know if this is broken, but all pops are loyalists. No other faction exsist. I have several sectors, though i do not allow other empires migration rights. Not sure whats supposed to trigger other factions.
6: My population does not seem unhappy, like ever. Ive not made any happiness buildings in my empire (i am at the battleship phase) and i can detect no negative effects.. Or if there are, they are not severe enough for me to care.
7: It does not feel like grand strategy.. It feels like most of the other 4x games recently, but in real time and with less depth.
8: Information: I struggle to keep track of the relations between other empires. Who are friends and who are enemies. I have a few enemies (as in ppl who hate me) but i have no reason to care :p I made a vassal out of one of the bigger empires in my part of the map and the other guys did nothing. I got no worried diplomats at my door, no federations (just leagues or anything like that) to curtail my aggression! They probably hate me a bit more but who cares? :p I did see my ally had some negative points vs me due to terror bombings 
I bombed enemy planets? Arent you supposed to do that to reduce fortifications? ^^ I even used the least aggressive stance!
Ive had 20hours playing this game, and i am bored :( 
Ive never been bored in a paradox game before, and i play most of them: Europa universalis, Hearts of Iron, Crusader kings, Victoria... 
It may be a good starting point for someone new to paradox, to ease them into a game without to much to worry about. But i cant recomend it to veterans of paradox games.
Or even anyone who are used to games like civilizations, or even realtime strategy games.
The realtime combat makes you want controll, but the game just wont let you.
I was so hyped for this, and now i am heartbroken. This was supposed to rekindle my love for the 4x genra and keep me playing for years(like victoria 2, crusader kings + +) and help me while waiting for Hearts of iron and Totalwar warhammer.
Ohwell, back to viking conquest i guess </3

281990,76561198006984439,94,158,3,True,26.3,May 20,"Stellaris is only an unenthusiastic recommendation from me. The game is competent, but uninspired. I don't regret buying it, and maybe it'll have a chance to come great with a bunch of patches and the obligatory DLC, but the game does nothing to overcome the mid to end game grind typical of the genre.
I've played 25 hours of Stellaris and restarted three or four times. Each time I expanded for around 6-10 hours or so with little in the way of competition, then started a completely unnecessary war out of sheer boredom. After either winning or stalemating the war, I looked around and observed that at the same rate I had at least another 6-10 hours of the same before hitting anything approximating a win condition. At this point I deleted my save game and started again.
The game’s big selling point, the supposed ‘stories’ that mix things up and make every game different, weren’t particularly obvious to me. My first game did result in an event where my civilization immediately spawned a 'splinter group' (basically, pirates). This ended up nerfing my start, but other than that I hunted them down and killed them, ending that particular story line. Every other game has largely followed the same trajectory, minus the initial rebellion.
Mostly, the same half dozen mini-missions (research anomalies) appear in regular rotation - ancient graffiti, ruined ancient organic star ship, ancient comet crashing into a planet, etc. Meh.
The other civilizations are all generic, and I regret my impulse preorder purchase to get a few more ‘cosmetic’ options for the other races in the galaxy (different portraits). These portraits don’t spend enough time on my screen for them to even register.
As far as emergent events are concerned numerous games do it far better. Spore’s end-game for one. Not to mention related procedurally generated SF ARPGs such as SPAZ and Space Rangers 2, where you can genuinely feel the life of the galaxy going on around you. In Stellaris, unfortunately, the universe feels almost entirely static and empty.
To finish on a few specifics, 75% of the gameplay seems to be micromanaging scout ships exploring and constructors building mines and research outposts, even into the late mid-game. There are no unit automation options, such as Civ's autoexplore and autoimprove, which is probably intentional since eliminating these two options would obviously also eliminate 75% of the gameplay.
Ship design feels like an add-on. Basically, research bigger ship size, maximise ship design for dps, research for a bigger ship size again… rinse and repeat.
Ultimately, playing on a sparse star field has little of the charm of Civ's changing geographies. In the absence of the buzz associated with discovering new coastlines, mountain ranges, swamps, rivers and cities, a space 4X really needs to offer something else. Stellaris promised to add that interest with its emergent storytelling. Sadly, with the game in its current empty state I’m not seeing it at the moment.			"

Good: Great early to mid game.  The best ""sim"" aspect of any 4x space game.  Micro-managers wet dream.
Bad:
1. Diplomacy is horrific.  Early to mid it is worthless.  Late it is nearly impossible move a faction one way or another.  
2. Combat is very simply early to mid almost so much so that it is boring.  Late combat is nearly impossible.  During the late stages when you have 10+ core sectors and you are part of a federation your navy is huge.  Probably around 50k+.  If your federation fights another alliance/federation that is of equil footing, just forget it.  You will get plastered.  Not because their fleet is bigger but because the computer just moves faster.  Not just thinking, their ships just move faster.  Now you might be thinking that is why my computer allies are for right?  Wrong.  Your computer allies does basically one thing when you as a federation/alliance go to war.  They all come to your biggest fleet and just follow you around.  I don't know if that is design flaw or intention but it sucks.  The computer fed/alliance is sending ships to like 10 to 15 systems all in small batches with landing forces.  As soon as they see your big fleet they jump and scatter.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to catch them.  I believe the intention to this tactic was to promote defense stations as they have FTL scramblers.  But at this stage a fleet that huge will blast that station and when your bigger fleet pops in will run and scatter.  Super frustrating.  It is an impossible endeavor to protect a large empire.
3. You cannot win a large map.  Victory conditions are 40% of inhabitable planets or complete domination.  600 stars = forever to conquer 40% let alone complete domination.  Even if this was doable (and I suppose several months of play time and you theoretically good) the combat system makes it impossible.  One big war and you are done.  There is no coming back from that.  The war will last forever because of their ""warscore"" method.  It would be an insanely long war.
I know this sounds pretty bad.  I am bit emotional because I just had my long game just get wrecked due to the combat system.  It is a great game, but right now they need to address some key late game issues.

You can meet advanced races or even those in primative ages, and lift them up as part of your empire, or Xfile them and infiltrate their governments until you run their entire world.

281990,gantolandon,45,71,0,False,18.6,May 12,"Can't recommend this game with clear conscience. Not yet.
It starts out great. The race creator is great. The galaxy is beautiful, as is the music. Exploring planets and discovering things is really fun. It looks and plays like a great game. Then it grinds to a screeching halt.
Plenty of promised features are absolute bare bones. There are, for example, very few diplomatic options compared to other Paradox games - mostly standard 4X stuff like declaring war, trading for resources, border access, etc. It could have been enough if half of this stuff wasn't broken . For example, you can't ask for civilian or military access if your borders don't touch, which means you can get blocked off by the AI and can't even remedy this short of going to war.
It's still better than the state of some other features. Sectors? They barely build anything, don't clear tile blockers, destroy strategic resources to build a Hydroponic Farm. Federations? Just a super-alliance witht he ability to build an additional fleet which counts towards the Presidents naval limit (so the AI will disband it as soon as it takes over). Internal politics? For 53 years I didn't even see a faction appearing, let alone a rebellion.
The AI also isn't anything to write home about. It used to have problem with expanding, though this seems to have been fixed in a beta patch. Still, it's pretty passive and content to leave you alone in your corner of the galaxy (unless it's some hyperaggressive personality). Sometimes it definitely has problems with waging war - when my enemy finally decided to crush me, they just flew their ships through all my systems then disappeared somewhere and didn't react as I bombarded one of their worlds into oblivion. Your allies and vassals just follow your main fleet, not even defending their core worlds when attacked.
And holy ♥♥♥♥, the lack of polish is glaring. I already wrote about broken sectors, which is compounded by the fact the game won't let you micromanage them and wants you to pay Influence just for taking a planet out. When the AI demands a planet as a wargoal and someone else takes it, it will never end the war. There is no automatic survey, you're supposed to click on every star you want to check out.  At least one late game crisis is impossible to be resolved because of broken triggers. There are plenty of examples where the game could have used more testing.

Pros:  
- The best 4X space game I have played since MOO.  All I wanted was the same feel and gameplay witout feature creep but updated.
- Great options to start the game with or simple quick start
- The extras are not tedious.  There is not too much to manage but just the right amount for me.
- Sooo much room for mods etc to make the game almost anything you want (I like EU games for this)  
Cons:
- ships looking the same
- a little generic feeling even though there are so many options.  Even though the text might be different the mechanics are much the same for every research project I have stumbled across.
Overall I think the game is amazing and has kept me glued to it when I thought I had burnt myself out on PC games and MMOs.  Truly a breath of fresh air! . .even though it is just better old awesome air.			"
281990,76561198007452654,28,41,0,False,138.4,May 16,"Paradox' latest title has gotten a lot of good reviews, but unfortunately I cannot agree with most of them.
Stellaris is a combination of 4X and Grand Strategy, but does neither one very good. It's very much like that pretty girl from the store you really like. You woo her and it starts off very fun, but after spending an evening with her she gets on your nerves and turns out to be extremely high maintenance.
Everything starts quite well, with an expansive customization of your empire, where you choose government form, ethics and starting technologies. The early game is definitely the best part of Stellaris: It has a lot of exploration, quests and interesting choices concerning your research and expansion.
This quickly turns around as you move into the midgame though. Quests dry up quickly, exploration comes to a full stop as you run into the borders of alien empires, and it turns out that where you expand to does not matter, as long as you do it quickly and grab as much stuff as you can. The where and how is not that important for a few reasons:
- The important resources, namely Energy and Minerals, can be gathered anywhere.
- The strategic resources are not very relevant.
To prevent you from becoming too powerful too quickly, Stellaris forces you to give up control of planets beyond the 5th. All extra planets must be put in Sectors, which are AI controlled regions. When asking Merni (a developer) on Twitter, she said that the main purpose of Sectors was to reduce micromangement.
This is not true. Not only do they increase micromanagement, as I will explain below, but there are techs and government forms that allow you to get player control over more of them. Meaning that it is seen as a direct bonus to be able to control them.
What is bad about sectors ? Well, here is a short list of problems:
- The AI is incompetent in managing their planets
- Sectors require resources to build up and then pay a tax (percentage of their income). The problem here is: they also stockpile resources that become inaccessible to you, and you have to constantly check if they need resources.
- You constantly have to check what they are doing and sometimes manually correct this
- Managing a planet in a sector requires something like 12 clicks.
- If you build a colony ship in a sector, it won't show up in your ship list. So you have to constantly check the map/systems
- You can only put an entire starsystem in a sector, not individual planets. So, if you have a system with 4 habitable worlds, of which you want to manage 1 because it's great, well that's too bad, you are screwed.
- You don't get quests for planets in sectors
- You don't get to do observation of lesser races in sectors, or at least don't get proper alerts for it
- Changing sectors costs influence, a rare resource. You can accidently, due to bad interface, burn through all your influence this way.
- In short, sectors cause a huge headache and an overwhelming amount of micromanagement, all just to screw over the player
Quests are another major annoyance. It all starts well, and the stories around them are pretty good. Unfortunately the quests are very shallow, and are almost exclusively: bring a science ship, and use the clicky. Unlike in a game like Civilization V for example, where City State quests require a lot of diferent types of things: gathering a resource, trading for a luxury, trying to get techs, a wonder, explore, kill barbarians... There is none of that here. The only quest you will get in this game is: Use the clicky, or spend some science points.
You will also start seeing repeat quests very quickly, likely within your very first game. As said above, sectors do not seem to provide quests properly. Maybe it's a bug, more likely it's a badly thought out feature.
Finally we come to the cluster♥♥♥♥ that is combat. There is a lot to go through here so lets get started with minor stuff:
- Land invasions are completely non-interactive. This is a lot worse than EU4, you just click and then well, wait.
- Land units can be equipped with an improvement. Except, no one tells you this, and there is no icon or link that gives an indication this is possible, you just have to find out.
- Land units have to be transported in ultravulnerable ships, you can't just have them on board of your fleet. It's just another headache.
- Space battles are completely non-interactive. Not only that, but your ships will actively pursue mining stations during a fleet battle for example, which can completely screw you over.
- Space battles starting in the mid game hog so much resources that it slows down (and possibly overheats) your pc.
- Most wars are determined in a single battle. While a player might be able to trap the AI's fleet through elaborate schemes in order to rebuild, the AI cannot do this. This means that if the AI engages you with an insufficiently big stack, it's dead and you just won the war as recovery is impossible
- Space wars are annoying, it's a lot of avoiding eachother since the bigger stack will almost always win, unless you built your fleet entirely wrong.
- Fleets can get stuck in situations of indecision, when they are floating between two equally attractive targets. They can also get stuck at long range without ever moving close enough to use their weapons.
- Fleets can get stuck in separate parts of your empire after a peace treaty, as you have no control over where they go after a war ends. They just go ""somewhere"".
- Interface is horrible when trying to manage multiple ships and/or fleets
The final pillar of the game, Science, starts as a very interesting novelty where you can choose from several different techs each time. While this is certainly an innovation, the randomness can completely screw you over, there is no in-game tech tree to see what you need for what.
Furthermore, you quickly run out of techs around the midgame, and everything you get after that is small passive bonuses. The ""dangerous"" late game techs provide only small advantages so they are not actually worth researching, and it's not incremental slippery slope deal either.
Aside of that, there are very, very few techs that offer interesting new things other than small upgrades to your ship tech. All interesting techs are in Societal research, where you unlock uplifting and genetic modifications.
Now, I'm not opposed to the idea of unlocking small upgrades, but there is nothing else to teching up. There are no wonders in this game, and very few unique things.
This leads to it all feeling very much the same. To the point even where at one point, a single techs unlocks 2 tiers (!!) of the same upgrade.
That brings us to the end of this complaint/review, with some loose comments:
- There is no trade
- There is no espionage
- The diplomacy is extremely shallow compared to EU4
- There are no luxuries and strategic resources are irrelevant
- The only victory conditions are either conquering everyone, or having 40% of the planets. There are no peaceful victories
- AI's will not actively pursue victory, they just hang around and don't do anything goal oriented.
- Talking about AI's: if you have allies or vassals in a war, they will do nothing (!!). They will just put their fleets on follow of your largest active fleet. So if your biggest fleet is in part A of the galaxy, and your invasion fleet is in part B and needs help... tough luck !
- I ""won"" 10 hours into my campaign, but needed 40 more to actually get to the victory screen. Once you snowball, unless you are stupid, nothing will be able to stop you. This becomes boring and tedious really fast.
In conclusion:
While this game looks good and starts of fine, it quickly becomes an overwhelming amount of micromanagement with very little strategy involved. This game will need several expansions before it gets really good, and will end up being a 100 € game before it's really enjoyable.			"
281990,haberdash,39,61,0,False,22.0,May 25,"First time writing a review, but I felt the need to warn others.
Was really intrigued by this game, as it hits all of my soft spots: 4x, space, etc. It looks awfully pretty, like a strategy version of Elite: Dangerous.
However, that's the end of my list of positives. If a game is a series of interesting choices, then this is not a game. Every part of it, from building and colonizing planets, to exploration, to combat, feels rote and superficial. You simply set up stations near resources, upgrade your level 2 mines to level 3 mines, build more corvettes, and wait for the queues to finish.
Combat is laughable, even after this recent patch. There's no reason to build anything other than corvettes, the basic ship. Tech upon tech adds complexity in the form of military stations, defense platforms, larger ships, etc, all of which are fairly useless. You simply build a corvette swarm, click on the enemy, wait for them to explode. Whee.
Other empires look fun, but are basically identical, with ethics providing a thin veneer of personality. Think Civ 5 AI, but without unique abilities, aggression, or anything else worth talking about.
A lot of hype was built around anomalies and exploration, but 90% of the anomalies I found simply unlocked a resource or gave me a research boost. No choices, nothing interesting. Even the flavor text was repetitive by my second game.
Ultimately, this has the depth of a $5-10 strategy game, with the blatant intention of filling in the gaping chasms with paid DLC and expansions. I feel conned out of my $40.			"

I have never been much of a 4x player or a grand strategy fan in the past, but something told me to pick this one up. Man am I glad I did. Stellaris really captures the feel of role playing a galactic empire. From the ethics and traits, to diplomacy and trade. To combat and wars. Each game takes hours and hours to complete. I'm currently on my 14th hour of the current game and have plenty more to go.
The fact that you can completely customize your starting race, complete with ethics and traits, and the fact that AI species are all completely randomly generated is what makes this really shine. Also, you can design your own ships with the technology you have researched. Awesome idea.
The only thing that has bugged me a bit, is the UI needs an overhaul. There are many areas where efficiency can really be improved when managing a lot of fleets and planets.
If you're a fan of space, and feel like ruling the galaxy, pick this game up. With improvements and DLC over time, this might be one of the greatest space games ever made.

...
...
...
Let us begin...
Once, not very long ago, on a gaming laptop in Europe, a mediocre strategy player decided to start his journey in galactic domination with an enlightened Human Spiritualist Empire.
This Empire soon spread across many systems of the 6-spiral-armed galaxy it resided in. Their people colonized as many Ocean, Ice and Gaia worlds that they could - knowing just how precious good space-real-estate is. 
Making sure to steer clear of the Galactic North, where a Fallen Empire of Holy Bird Guardians skulked - deeply depressed after finding out about the looming expansion of KFC into the wider galaxy - the Spiritualist Humans found a planet in the Galactic East, with a Primitive Turtle Civilization on it.
The planet was called - Bowl... Just because.
Studying these aliens gave the Humans the idea to uplift and vassalize this burgeoning species... But! 
At an incredibly frustrating 98/100 integration completion schedule - the Early Space Age Turtles... Became Late Space Age Turtles... In other words... GG NO RE...
But that was not the end... oh, no... It was the beginning of a 200-year-long animosity between the now Materialist Militaristic Turtles of Bowl and the - very dashing - Human Spiritualist Empire...
In those 200 years, the Turtles of Bowl caused maaaaany grievances to their poor Human neighbours...
Regularly stealing nearby Ocean Worlds because they were shell-wearing bullies,
joining an alliance with 3 other relatively large Space Empire that veeeery much rivalled the Humans (Literally speaking),
SOMEHOW managing to grab several systems with their sneaky-sneaky Frontier Outposts...
And FINALLY... After the Star-Concordat - the annoyingly un-inferior Alliance of Turtles, 2 different Mushroom-peoples and a... Thing...? (Something that looks like a Syntax Error in a story called 404_EMPIRE_NOT_FOUND) - began their war against the gloriously under-armed Spiritualist Human Empire... They somehow...

281990,Riverdusk,15,18,0,True,29.3,May 10,"Overall first impression:  The game is a lot of fun.  
If you were put off by the learning curve of Paradox's other stratgey titles (CK and EU), but still like the idea of a grand strategy/4X game, this is a very good one.  It is easy to get into as you start with just one planet and build your empire slowly from scratch.  I found myself immersed in it quickly.
I have not gotten very far into it yet, as all the choices you have to create your race, planet, government, galaxy, etc. can take you quite a while.  I then played on slow speed quite a bit just looking around the galaxy and watching the ships, etc. do their thing.  It is real time, not turn based, but there are 5 different speed settings and you can also pause anytime you wish and still issue orders.  You can play it as fast or as slow and casual as you wish.
The eXploring, eXpanding, and eXploiting are fairly standard, but made more interesting with good writing with the random events that pop up, and they are plentifiul.   I haven't done too much eXterminating yet except for some pirates.  Combat is graphically nicely displayed, but it is auto-resolved.  As others have said, you are the emperor, not the admiral. 
Game has run smooth for me, although it did seriously heat up my computer,  Sometimes happens with my setup, not just with this game, and the usual fix of limiting the game to 60fps worked to fix the issue.
I'll update if necessary once I get more into mid to late game, but so far I can see putting a lot of hours into this one and it is well worth it.

281990,beautifulwhitekitten,86,148,6,False,17.4,May 12,"Looking at my hours on the game, you couldn't possibly treat this review as one that carries great depth. But I could not honestly play past 2 hours per session, out of sheer boredom. This review will explain why to all the people who dismiss me as being too attached to EU4. 
1. The economy mechanics. 
They are boring, nonintuitive, clicky, nondynamic, and simple- in a bad way. The system is based off of buildings you make which give you a flat increase of income a turn. Personally, this ""+1 plot"" system is not what I expected from Paradox. Paradox has been known for their complex economic systems- Trade in EU4, Production in Victoria and HOI, and feudal taxes in Crusader Kings. Seeing that Stellaris doesn't even have a trade mechanic, which I feel is a lost opportunity here, when dynamic trade nodes would be *such* a great addition to the game. Instead, they decide to completely remove one of the greatest features of a Grand Strategy game in this '4x/Grand Strategy hybrid' under the justification of 'keeping it simple'. I would argue that there is a difference between keeping it simple, and not even including an important mechanic. 
2.The warfare mechanics.
They are boring, nonintuitive, spamfesty, and carry very little player interaction. ""Designing your own ships"" is about as useful or rewarding as adding a paper sticker onto a cup and calling it a 'design'; it has little to no impact on anything, as the game already appears to have the most proficient design ready for you anyway. Not that designs really make a difference either, as the battle is based on sheer numbers; mainly two. Armor, and armor penetration. There is no maneuvering going on here, there is no composition or 'specialization' that is effective here. I cannot heavily comment on this personally, but I do believe that even those who enjoy this game criticise the warfare mechanics.
3. The Diplomacy mechanics.
Nonexistant. Besides the cosmetics, the diplomacy mechanics are only *just a tad better* than civilization's. I'll just quote the Wiki on the features:
-Establishing an embassy to improve relations with an AI nation (embassies have no effect in a multiplayer game if established between two human players)
-Sending an insult to reduce relations
-Offering an alliance (a strong alliance with 4 or more participants may become a Federation)
-Offering a trade agreement (trade agreements can include non-aggression pacts, map-sharing, resources, research access, -border access, and migration between nations)
-Demanding a weaker AI enemy becomes your vassal
-Declaring war
-Declaring another nation your rival (resulting in both parties gaining Influence)
Simplistic, alright.
4. DLC Platform
I will never understand how people will conform to companies shoving out such a minimal game and charging full price for it on the grounds that 'they'll fill out the holes with expansions later!'. People should not allow themselves to be continuously abused with DLC containing content that should have been in the base game.

And no, I'm not a Paradox fan boy who buys or supports dlc just for the sake of it. I simply don't mind paying for something that is worth it, and more often that not, Paradox deliver - simple as.
On the whole, I would recommend this game to anyone with even the slightest interest in rts space games. It definitely has that ""one more turn"" ingredient similar to CK2 and EUIV and two play hours can easily turn into six in the blink of an eye - you have been warned :-)
Buy it - you owe it to yourself to experience this.			"

3. very in depth features for species creation
4. Randomly generated universes to keep each game unique and different
Cons:
1. Combat seems a bit straightforward, weapons counter certain shields but bad agianst other ones, but it is hard to know what you're going up against so you have trouble preparing.

My inner fangirl keep screaming all night. Maybe this will be changed later, but on the first glance game is awesome.
Yes, it less scientific then MoO3 but more deep then MoO2 and it's clones. The core thing in this game - Paradoxes remove the great curse of ""grabbing every flying rock on your way"". In the Stellaris Universe only few planets can support life, so out of dozen close systems I got only 3 good (including homeworld) and one arctic planets. 
Well, this game is a good successor of Star Trek and I would like to see Star Trek mod on it, or even DLC.
Gameplay is simple and well-known to the paradox fans:
- pausable real-time;
- indirect battles;
- ""city""-building; 
- weird diplomacy;
- mini-quests;
- great leaders;
- some science.

281990,tbonebiggins,34,54,0,False,16.9,May 15,"Really cool atmosphere, really cool ideas, this is a well done game in several aspects. In the end it completely screws up in too many ways to where it's a tedious grind. In the end I wish I did not buy this game at 25% off for $30.  So how does this game mess up? I will tell you about some things you need to look up:
-War Score System: You have to declare up to a few planets as your goal, then after you take them you cannot fight the enemy empire in any way no matter what due to an end of war treaty that lasts 10 years. Basically you can be 1 planet shy of defeating an enemy and it gives them a 10 year cooldown.
-The populations you conquer are never happy. NEVER. They will rebel. Destroy buildings. Production of their resources is cut in half if they even produce resources. The planet you just took is useless. This can be fixed with purging, but you must be a collectivist (communist) or xenophobic empire to do so and it will anger all other alien races at you. So if you want to conquer people you cannot make peace with anyone.
-Even if you purge the populace and get a planet under control you cannot control more than 5 or so planets at a time. The game will then force a harsh penalty for governing so many planets. The only way to take away this penalty is to draw off sectors on a map and have all planets in that sector automated. This. Is. Stupid. You cannot build what you want,  the AI is incompetent, and upgrades and improvements to your planets just DO. NOT. HAPPEN. So basically for most governments you can have 5 planets you can control and once they are maxed out the rest of your planets have to be automated and turned into giant paperweights. 
-Needing influence to make frontier stations to expand borders just so you can mine empty planets with resources. Influence grows way too slowly for established planets. Your borders are literally static, and each frontier outpost puts a -1 modifier on your influence income. Influence is used for lots of things, so if you expand your borders guess what? You cannot afford new leaders and certain edicts like managing rebellious factions in your empire. Even some buildings cost influence. 
-The game in general punishes expansion and growth. Stellaris HARSHLY PUNISHES MILITARY CONQUEST. The devs literally are trying to force you to be peaceful with at least most of your neighbors or else you are stuck. Conquered planets are nigh useless with their native populations, you cannot bomb the populations to death from orbit and re-colonize it yourself, there is literally no friggin way to win with warfare in this game. There just isn't. The rebellious factions cause more issues than they are worth and demand to be returned to an empire you conquer and defeated 50 years ago. And the moment they have freedom? I declare war on them, steamroll them again with superior fleet, the whole rebellion until we get our freedom thing happens again. THIS IS VERY STUPID.  You can't even land armies to use as police units to ensure the populace at least let your buildings function. 
-Broken mechanics on planet control. You have major efficiency debuffs for having more than 5-7 planets pending government type. You split up planets you own into sectors then. How does this make sense forcing you to automate planets? You can take 20+ planets and make them into one giant sector under control of one governor and HE doesn't get any debuffs, does he? The devs intended for multiple sectors but the system is flawed and broken, especially since the AI controlled planets don't utilize resources properly. I cannot emphasize that enough, even if you order them to respect natural tile resources they ignore it and put down a lab. The sector hoards it's own resources seperate from you, too. So while a giant mega-sector can have more resources than you the guy in charge of the empire, you still have to buy ships and pay for maintenance on them. Make sense yet? Nope, never does never will. 
Summary: Broken mechanics were ripped from other Paradox games and shoehorned in, in a very awkward manner. There are even complaints from some long-time Paradox fans that some of the mechanics just don't make sense in this game. War score makes no sense in the galactic scale, might have worked for European wars in EU4 but that and all the other non-sense in Stellaris just makes no sense. It kills immersion and drags the game down in a bad way.
There is a lot more wrong with this game. I might edit and update later, but in general this is not worth the effort. A fanboy will not get to this point before down-voting my review, so why keep explaining? There are many flaws to the logic in this game, from army transports all the way down to integrating aliens into your society. This is my first jump into a Paradox strategy game and I'm massively disappointed. Yes, they traded the icky historical theme for a cool sci-fi theme. That is a great step. But seriously, the devs put so many disincentives into the game that you are forced to play a certain way or else your empire will be crippled. We haven't had any good 4x space games since Space Empires 4 + 5. Stellaris did not fill that niche, in fact it's a pro-peace panzy ripoff of Distant Worlds. If you want 4x in RTS format get Distant Worlds: Universe instead. I know, the price sucks. There are rare sales, but it's worth full price. Stellaris loses compared to DW:U in every gameplay aspect.

281990,Gatsu_88,107,188,4,True,24.3,May 22,"Stellaris is a grand strategy game set in space, made by Paradox. It's perhaps the first strategy game I have played in a very long time. When I was younger, Command & Conquer games were some of my favorites and also Age of Empires, but during the years I jumped into different genres I guess. I haven't played Paradox's earlier games much at all, but I absolutely love Stellaris.
In Stellaris, your goal is to build a galactic empire. When you start the game, you have the option of choosing from about 8 pre-defined species to start your journey as. Or you can completely create your own species, which I enjoy doing. There's about 6 species groups and 60-70 different species to choose from, home planet type, design of your ships/buildings, your traits that define your race. Like breeding speed, are they militaristic empire or peaceful ones. I maybe used one hour on first time to design my Fox people. It's really fun :).
Before starting game, you get to choose the galaxy size, galaxy shape from few options, AI opponent amount etc. Max amount of stars currently is 1000 and it is huge! 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685944206
Anyway, there are a lot of things you get to customize before you begin conquest. Also there is a thing called ""Iron Man"" mode, which I didn't realize to put on first. It's like a hard more and you only have one save game, the auto save. So there is no returning back from mistakes. It also enables achievements.
The gameplay is fun and there are a lot of things to learn. It's just a pure joy watching the solar systems, exploring new areas and slowly spreading your empire. It can feel overwhelming first. The kind of slow pace in this game is great. You will encounter many new species and will they be your enemy or friend, that is up to you. 
Combat isn't very detailed, but that is okey. The tutorial also for is good and the AI-voice helps a lot along the way if you choose so.
Multiplayer is sweet. Friends can join your game and take control of one AI species, so you can conquer the galaxy together. Or you can start a new game completely.
Soundtrack of Stellaris is quite epic and it's very enjoyable to listen to while exploring. OST  reminds me of movies like Interstellar and Tron Legacy or games like Mass Effect and Deus Ex:Human Revolution. So fans of those will surely love it. A good music is important with a long game like this in my opinion.
Anyone who loves sci-fi and strategy genre, pick this game up. You will maybe like Stellaris too. I can imagine spending hundreds of hours with this. I'd play it non-stop if I only didn't have so many other games to play too.
It's a stellar experience.			"
281990,76561197984753485,91,159,2,False,100.8,May 20,"Combining Master of Orion with Europa Universalis, that just has to be the one of the greatest game ideas ever.  
At the beginning, the game feels awesome. The races are well designed, and researchable technologies are more or less scientifically realistic. The 3 different FTL technologies give a nice strategic depth to the game, which can also be at times frustrating. 
The game lacks diplomatic relation mechanisms. It is hard to see or understand why some races attack you.  Even playing passively your neighbors randomly declare war on you. Trying to gain an ally is often hindered by missing a few positive relation points with no way to gain further points. Often I ended up as a strong lonely nation that gets beaten down by strong alliances. If I finally manage to gain an alliance friend, I get a declaration of war by some other alliance further away that somehow manages to pass through occupied space to invade my planets. I am sure this can be understood after a certain amount of play time, still the different map overviews in EU4 were a lot easier to analyze. Here are none. 
Further the AI tends to create many small fleets. Fighting 2 nations with different FTLs at the same time, each of them having 5-6 perfectly micromanaged fleets, while you are trying to send your 2-3 larger fleets defending your empire is rather annoying. Not to mention, bigger fights even bring the best PCs to its knees with 2-3 FPS. The CPU just canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep up.
The early game has been nicely polished and gives a positive playing experience. The further you get into the game, the more unfinished elements appear.

You constantly have to choose between resources and what to spend them on. The ""small"" universes have 100 solar systems and take days to complete. This game manages to keep you at a strategic level with micromanagement minimized to a perfection. 
From the time I have played it seems to have a lot of replaybilty, not only because games will take days to complete but everything from what I have seen is procedurally built. You are not going to have the same game twice, they might be similar but one time you might start in a resource poor solar system all alone and your fighting to just survive, the next time your in a solar system that is rich in resources and eveyone wants to get you. Even the tech tree has randomness to it, not to the extent of you have no idea what you will unlock but it seems that once you research 1 item it unlocks a few from the next level, this prevents you from knowing the future.

281990,76561198102537785,17,24,2,False,190.8,May 28,"This game is boring. Very boring.
You start off exploring the galaxy and that part is fun. But, fairly soon, you've finished that part of the game and you're into the part of the game where you're developing your star civilization. And there's nothing to do there. You get to make meaningless choices between technologies with futuristic-sounding names, and watch the AI develop the planets that you've colonized. And this goes on for hours and hours and hours. I've read that there's an epic war at the end of the game, but I've only played the game for about 100 hours, I haven't got that far yet.
There's a tile development mini-game within a game, as is traditional for Civilization-like games, but the developers decided to force you to let the AI do that for you. I don't know why the game's designers bothered to code this mini-game if they weren't going to let the players play it.
Wars with the AI are boring. You don't fight the battles yourself - that's all handled by the AI. You move your star ship fleets around on the map, trying to bring the AI to battle on your terms. If your fleet is bigger, chances are that'll be relatively easy. Then you get to watch the AI for your fleet ROFLstomp the AI for the AI's fleet. It's pretty the first few times, but after a while it gets old.
In fairness, the developers have said that there's a whole bunch of mid-game events that they didn't have time to code before releasing the game. They've said they expect to get that code added to the game by the end of June. We'll see. But in the meantime, if you like watching the AI play against itself, this is the game for you.			"
281990,76561197992125869,139,250,8,False,48.2,May 10,"Unfortunately, the game is weak. Already played through on hardest and managed to dominate the AI while making numerous errors and being essentially stuck and unable to colonize in the early mid-game. I was hoping for a EUIV in space. You have a force-limit, you have to have a CB to attack regions of space etc. etc. This game is like every other 4X game. In-fact it is a step back to something like the still unsurpassed Distant Worlds for the sake of this review I am going to compare it to such:
edit: Finally ran into all of the BUGS: I have had the AI send a 5k stack of ships one at a time instead of a fleet across my sector. I have zoomed into a fight and then zoomed out to the map only to have a destroyed battleship replace the stars in the background as well as numerous graphical glitches. The save/load broke where when I loaded a game it would take me to empty space with nothing in it, losing me hours of progress. I have had a fleet stuck, unable to decide between two starbase on which one to attack and just flying in circles. Not to mention that wormholes are broken with allies. 
- The world is lifeless. Distant worlds had a public and a private sector so you could see public sector ships flying through space, grabbing resources and hauling them back to the colony. None of that here. You build a science or mineral outpost and thats it. 
- The ship building is also useless. The modules are boring as all hell: you just have laser I then 2 etc. Why even customize the ships. In distant worlds, you had complete freedom to add modules to the ship up to their limit. You could make ships as small or as large as you like. Star Drive also had an inovative system where you can places modules on a grid. Even Gal Civ 4 allowed you to customize the look of the ships. 
- Colony management is still in the dark ages: Blockers!? Adjecency bonuses. These are all tired, worn concepts. Dumping everything into sectors just to get rid of the tedium is not a solution! Sectors should be the primary means of control, not systems.  
- Diplomacy, what diplomacy: On Hard and up, it is extremely difficult to get alliances or form federations so that mechanic is all but wiped out. Federation 10 year time, puff puff pass mechanic, is silly anyway. They built a game like CK2 where you could have a family, a lineage, gain and lose huge regions of land in one generation and here we are back with the staid governors etc. What a waste. 
(protip: Built massive amounts of mineral resources. Don't focus on energy. Befriend another empire who also gets massive energy reserves that they do not use and keep trading minerals for energy and win. Pro-er tip: you cannot run into debt so in the end retool everything to minerals and WIN with your massive 200k Doom stacks. Energy maintenance, WTF is that. I used the red shard tech as my only offensive tech and won. Battleship? More like here comes 50 corvettes up your â™¥â™¥â™¥, all evading your shots.) The game is broken as is. But maybe in some magical future world, Paradox carves it into a gem. I live in the present. I don't live in the ""What if they..."" 
-Distant worlds you could get creamed by pirates, massive alliances, late game invasions. Here, you have terrible Ai to deal with who never attack you as well as a few roaming monsters that do nothing until you attack them.
It gets worse: If the AI were to become super agressive, you would be all but wiped out because of the bonuses they receive. I have a feeling this is why you are never engaged. It would make the game unplayable on harder difficulties. 
Edit: The AI is even worse than I thought, which explains their passive nature: My vassel was declared on by a large empire. They took ages to finally move their superior fleet into my territory, while I huddled my ships in a corner, waiting for the end. They proceeded to attack my home world, destroy the station, then they !split! their fleet with one half buggering off to some distant corner of my empire and the other being immediately ambushed by my fleet and destroyed. A further note: while most 4X titles have some kind of limitation on the range of your ships i.e. Distant Worlds has fuel, this game allows you to just hop to ends of the universe. Effectively making wars highly one-sided with no ability to recover as you never have to retreat your forces from enemy territory. You destroy all their starbases and win. Distances are too long, fleets take too long to rebuilt. Wars are unrecoverable.   
-Micromanagement is from the dark ages here. In Distant Worlds, you can automate everything or nothing. It is up to you, yet here in 2016, in Stellaris, I cannot assign production orders (edit: I want to stress how insane this oversight is: when you queue up two ships for instance, resources are deducted for both! Even though only one is being built. If you are attacked, you can simply cancel and receive all of your resources back even if the ship is 98% built WTF paradox! That's programming year one!) to stations or rally points! I have no control over my fleets in battle so I sit and watch as they spread damage over the entire enemy force instead of focus firing. 
WORST OF ALL: I cannot automate the GODDAM science and construction vessels. I have to shift click every single debris research in a sector of my god are you kidding me.
Overall: The game is clearly unfinished. This is a bare shell, wich might hopefully be filled by future development, but do not buy it yet. Wait until it is patched severely and content is added. This is another in a long string of dissapointing 4X titles. You can do better Paradox. 
This is a space 4X game and I have already beaten it on the hardest difficulty. That is saying something,
Edit: The positives: I did have a very cool moment where my race became so populace that when I declared war on the once mighty bird people, I find that their leader is a member of my race, having presumably stabbed his way to leaderhood. I have to admit that that was a new one. Never saw that before in any 4X.			"

281990,76561198097379184,18,26,0,False,62.5,June 26,"The game has great potential but does not live up to basic expectations. For such a proven developer and so many similar games to pull reference from, this game is surprisingly bare-bones, like playing chess with only pawns (you might see the great idea behind it but it will get boring fast).
What is missing:
- Trade. The most important economic mechanic and reason for war or not to go into it is missing altogether
- Spaceship combat is bare bones. Everyone tries to build one big ball of death and throws it at the other. Bigger and badder ball wins and the looser has no chance to recover as it would need to build a new ball from the start. No strategy, no tactics, and leaders effect is too small to take into count
- Planetary invasion is bare bones. This is something from the DEVs from Hearts of Iron, still there is no strategic or tactical options to it. Big ball army invades planet when defence is down to 0 that is it. There are detachments to armies but these are so micro-management intensive, give little bonus and don't even show up for the army in most situations to be a visual fluff. Was this really done by them same guys who developed HoI?
- Spying is completely missing. It is not researhable or needs a building, it simply does not exist and neither any scripted events hinting on its possible existence in interstellar politics, warfare and economics.
- A reason to have factions. They do not do much despite having an elabarote pop system behind them. They sometimes annoy a bit but interaction with them is bare-bones, boring and ultimatively meaningless. Civil war? Does not exist
- Leaders do not do anything besides giving 5% on something. No scripted events for them, or the chance to grow into a character who actually can make a difference meaning that a fleet commander will not turn the tide in battle, and  a legendary research officer will not help the empire to a notable research advantage. This is a buffling trend among developers to be fair, it seems that lately non can see the uselesness of a feature which adds 1-15 % to something but requires micro-management (next step will be to use modifiers of 0.05% in games like this so that it will in no way, in any possible circumstance upsets balance instead of implementing these in  a meaningfull mechanic so that they are par of the balance)
- Scripted diplomatic events. If you don't have a complex game that allows for it with meaningful leaders, trade and espionage this feature might have saved the day but regicide, religious wars, or anything outside of the poisibilities of the basic gameplay is but a wish
- Federation and alliance do not offer any meaningful options to interract with the AI
- Customisation options for ship appearance (In a 4X space sim this is quite interesting how it could be missing)
- Not enough empire colours on the strategic map to distinguish them properly! That is right, apperantly there wasn't time or budget to provide enough colours (its like the Ford T of 4X games)! 3/3 games had me fighting next to the same colour as my own empire
The game has a somewhat strong opening with exploration and scripted events but these things get old fast and it does not currently have any fleshed-out mechanic to keep the play going afterwards.
Wait for a couple of patches at least + one expansion before considering again. Guess will update this review when it improves but not sure if the first expension will be enough to make even a dent in the above. Probably needs 2 more years and 3 expensions or so to make it recommendable.			"

At it's current state the game is playable albeit very unpolished. It is very similar to Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron and unfortunately is rife with micromanagement of the latter one. You have to constantly tweak your planets, pay attention to science and construction vessels and negotiate with dozens of empires which sounds interesting at first but quickly turns into a repetitive chore. Allowing faster ways to switch between planets and auto-upgrading of planet tiles should be a priority for Paradox.
The whole vassal system seems to be unfinished as well - AI will never build or upgrade space ports and ships, and you have to manually select every planet in sector from the map to do it yourself.
Other than a lot of unnecessary micro and lack of some UI features the game is actually pretty solid even without 100 inevitable dlc's paradox is going to release. The graphics are decent, the music is good, AI makes ""some"" effort and it is true that it doesn't actually attack you the moment they become slightly superior like in other 4x games.
The game also restricts your expansion with influence points, borders and lack of habitable planets. Even on a huge map with 1000 planets you won't get that many colonies before you are surrounded by other empires. This means that unless they are really lucky with starting point and resources - everyone is going to be more or less equal mid game. Which can be good or bad depending on how fast you built those frontier bases which extend your borders early on.
I can recommend this game even in it's current state. I have no doubt that paradox is going to release numerous patches and dlc's to address most of those issues. Considering that modding support is also there we can expect a lot of custom races like star wars, star trek, babylon 5, etc that will make this game even better.			"

Note: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.
  Field Rating Review   Graphics 9 Overall, the graphics are very well done, particularly the art of the races. The only downside I would say, is that battles feel a bit lackluster. The ships all clump together and it makes the battles difficult to enjoy as it is hard to see anything (particularly if there are any aura effects). Luckily, mods quickly solve this issue!   Gameplay 9 Stellaris is a deeply complex game, but you would never guess it right away. There are so many ways to manage your empire, let alone your fleet. The complexity of the game is well hidden beneath an interface that is incredibly easy to navigate. Here are some examples of what you can do: Create Sectors in your empire that can be auto-managed by the ai (focusing on fields you tell it to), declare edicts in each of those sectors, customize each ship design in your fleet, research a vast array of technologies, declare war on various empires using a war point system, form alliances, form federations, assign governors, assign admirals, assign generals, assign scientists, research various anomalies around the galaxy, allow open migration of races between borders, influence primitive populations you discover, purge populations, decide between several types of government (military dictatorship, democracy, etc), deal with various factions that arise in your empire with subterfuge, demand another empire free some of their planets, fight forgotten empires...The list goes on and on. My friend and I have put in over 20 hours just to ONE game, and it isn't even the largest map type (up to 1000 stars, and more with mods). This is galactic war on a grand scale. Manage multiple fleets, balance resources, and strike out alone, or with your friends, to become the supreme power in the universe. There are also surprise events that happen in the game, such as various alien invasions, or robot uprisings. Overall, a fantastically done 4x RTS. You can pause, or speed up time. The only downside I've found is how hard it is to conquer another empire. Due to the war point system you cannot simply roll over another empire and claim it all as yours, you can only take a set number of planets (or you can make them vassals).   Story N/A The only story here is the one you write yourself as you spread your empire.   Multiplayer 10 Some of the largest multiplayer battles you will ever encounter in an RTS. Play against, or with, up to 32 players. Ally with your friends, forge rivalries or fragile treaties with others.  Immensely fun for everyone involved.    Replayability 9 With so many factions to play, and so many different ways to play, you can try all kinds of various paths before you'll burn out on Stellaris.   Overall 9.1/10 Paradox has done it again. A masterpiece of a game, and a surprise hit (for me). I normally shy away from 4x titles, but Stellaris caught my eye and I gave it a go. Finally, my RTS itch has been scratched. A highly complex game hidden beneath a deceptively simple interface, Stellaris welcomes players of any skill level to come and enjoy conquering the galaxy. So dive in, and be prepared to smile as you expand your empire, laugh at your enemies demands, or watch in horror as an invading alien force rolls across the galaxy, and only you and you friends stand in its way.

By then it will be patched more and be cheaper. Right now Stellaris has several funfamental problems (sectors, AI, diplomacy, to name a few) and it is still being patched regularily. The swinging balance changes makes me question whether even the developers know what they want this product to be.
There is one other reason to wait, and that reason is mods. Mods are, hands down, the biggest reason to buy this game. There are several total conversion mods in the works. Including StarWars, Star Trek, Warhammer 40K, Mass Effect, StarGate, and others. Unfortunately none of them are out yet, but they undoubtedly will be by Dec. Wait until Winter sales.

While Stellaris looks great and promises a lot, it feels like a game that is still in development, with a lot of its content missing. A early access game. Something that is only emphasized by the huge 1.1 patch.

281990,76561197963756342,28,46,3,False,64.0,June 3,"This game is just ""okay"". The company, however, is awful. Paradox recently decided to moderate and ban mods for any arbitruary reason. They banned my mod ""European Phenotypes and Names"" - and then proceeded to lie about me and my mod. If you don't believe me, go to my YouTube ""Progeny of Europe"" and watch what happened (can't put links here), everything is archived there so you can get all the facts without the media runaround or the Paradox misinformation. I even recieved death threats as a result of what they did.
You don't have to like me or my mod - but you should at least know what kind of company you are dealing with. And any modder should beware - they take your mod down through a STEAM BAN. So, if you are thinking about modding this game, just know this is a possibility and be aware of the risks associated with it.
Edit:
Paradox's official and final word (an email to me):
""I was asked to get in touch with you so am now taking the opportunity to do so.
We were originally going to discuss the circumstances around your previous mod submission, it does appear now though that you've already successfully resubmitted it.  With that in mind and considering you appear to be firmly moderating it we feel there's nothing more needing to be said in the matter.""
That's right, the modder - according to Paradox (no TOS or anything states this anywhere) - is completely responsible for COMMENTS left on their mod. I have a video showing the comments left on my mod - out of around 86 comments only 2 were 'somewhat' eye brow raising. But this was enough to issue a ban via Steam. As a modder you have no control over the comments besides clickng ""delete"" - an absurd standard and rule just created on the fly. No one has time to have a second job moderating the comment section, nor was it ever stated you had to.
This is their statement, after the lied and called me a, ""racist"", ""white supremacist"", that my mod (somehow) ""discriminated"" against people, that I ""changed the description to make it racist"" - archives show I only changed it once (to let people know it still worked even if it said out of date) and never had anything ""racist"" in it.
So this is what you get, a company that will lie and slander you in order for them to not take responsibility for something as trivial as deleting a mod.
Modders beware.

281990,76561198008685947,45,78,4,False,34.6,May 13,"I played one full game to completetion and multiple to the glacial grind point. As it stands the game isnt horrible, but there isnt enough variety for more then maybe one full playthrough. I am going to describe my full playthrough experience so a bit of spoiler warning here.
The early game is great. You survery around get your mini quests(situation log) and major quests which gives you a drive to finish and see what you get. You encounter probably 3-4 ""neutral"" aliens(prismatic, ameoba, void, mining, and the gas grazers) Learn more about them get trait specific options to resolve those quests. You research is quick lets you branch out and see what you focus on. Then you run into another Alien empire, which essentially walls you off from exploring or questing. This gives you three options go explore somewhere else, amass a fleet to eventually attack them to get them out of your way, or ally with them(which is basically the same as conquering them). You talk to the empire which is pointless unless you want to trade embassies and wait till you can form an alliance(which having one early makes it easier in the late game but ill get there).
The mid game is alright. At this point you have run into a few more alien factions, started colonizing other planets to expand your borders, and research is starting to slow down. They will start offering to trade star charts which ends up being a trap. While it is nice to be able to see more of the galactic map and resources they hold, it also removes the option to survey those worlds which means no anomolys(quests) Once you see more of the map you start to see that you are now boxed in by alien factions leaving you only two choices, ally with them or attack them. Since the diplomacy screen is basically ""do you have an embassy?"" most of the time you wont be able to invite them into an alliance, but usually that first alien you met will likely join up with you. So now you build your fleet that at max consists of 4 different ships: corvette, destroyer, cruiser, battleship based off of your shipyard level. ONLY 4 FOR EVERY RACE/FACTION. Granted you can ""customize"" each ship trying to make a more well rounded fleet with different weapon types, but you will fall into hitting the auto-best option because you cant counter the different types without knowing the types the enemy has. Anyways you built your fleet, then look at the diplomacy tab to see if the person you are about to attack has equal or less then fleet strength and you declare war. You set your war goals(anything other then vassalization just means your going to have to war with them again). Ally AI is set to put thier fleet ontop of your highest military power fleet. So now you send your death ball into their system you see thier fleet is numerically lower then the combined fleet of you and your ally and you clash. You get to sit and wait as the  ships just charge and swirl around each other until one fleet is dead. Your warscore goes up a bit for winning. You need at least 70% to win a war. Since you decimated thier fleet there wont be anymore fleet battles so now you have to build an army to take planets. Sit your fleet over a planet until the plantery defense number hits 0 and drops troops if you have a higher number you win and planet taken. Based off of how big the enemy empire is you will have to repeat this until you win the war. You WIN and now have a vassal!(which means you now have another ally to help you fight wars).
The late game and it is terrible. Research now takes decades even with all the research buffs you can muster. You have expanded  colonizing, frontier posting, or integrating your vassals(which takes exponetially longer based off thier size, one vassal took roughly 100 years). Entire map is seen you cant finish some of your quests(precurser alien quest), and some end game event happens. Mine was the prethorian scourge invaded the galaxy. At some point a quest to seize their queen appeared but it bugged out and i couldn't finish the quest. THe Prethorian scourge was systemactically infesting worlds and conquering empires. It was a cool event which spiced things up, until i realized that the ai factions didnt care about stopping it. It was just another day in the galaxy to them. So i was like fine I will handle it myself until i realize that the prethorian scourges planets cant be captured or destroyed. I had to systemactically go to every planet they had and leave a fleet in orbit bombing so they wouldnt produce anything anymore. With roughly half of my fleet capacity left to endlessly bomb unkillable ai i looked at the victory condition page. Only two options colony 40% or kill off everyone else which essentially boiled down to the same thing. Declare war on everybody who wasnt an ally or vassal. At this point is where the game reaches it most boring and it will happen for evey game you play(since there are no other victory conditions). Build battleships and train armies, declare war, demand vasslization kill enemy, invade planet, Systemaccally taking over the galaxy which may sound fun but it boils down to number battles. You spend more time building then fighting. Eventually you will win and it will be unsatisfying.
TLDR Pros and Cons
Pros
- Turnless civ game in space!
- Very pretty
- Anomolys(quests)
- Cool research options(for the most part)
- Early game
Cons
- Diplomacy and everything about it
- Influence(could have been an awesome diplomacy resource just ends up holding you back)
- Mid and Late game end up a boring repetitive slog
- DIFFERENCES IN RACES AND SHIPS, this kind of a big one. All races and ships are basically the same(aside from appearance) give me something that plays different .No purely robotic race, no zerg(plethorian scourge should have some sort of playable varient) One of the fallen empires has a ring world system I WANT IT why can i not have it?,
Final Verdict
I can't recommend because after one playthrough you just wont want to play another because nothing really will change. I have tried ended up the same every game, especially the end game which is a snorefest. The game has a solid core to build upon and from what i hear these developers actually do stuff so i look forward to the future where this game is a must buy.
Recommended changes.
-More and varied research paths WITH FASTER SPEEDS or make a gameplay speed button measured in years because days doesnt cut it.
-more and varied quest missions
-more victory conditions
-espionage and better diplomacy (USE INFLUENCE)
-an even faster speed up option
-more and varied base starting points(MAKE DIFFERENT EMPIRES PLAY DIFFERENTLY)
-more and varied ships and weapons(wouldn't a militaristic have more then pacifists?!)
-Do something with armies(who pays attention to moral?)			"

281990,comradewinston,10,13,0,True,114.1,May 21,"A pretty good Paradox 4x strategy game, simpler than EU4. You can create pretty much anything from a race of run-of-the-mill humans to space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. From hippie-dippy xenophile democracies, to hive mind hegemonic empires that expunge all xenos in their path. Ships can be heavily customized and from the very start, you choose which type of FTL and weapons you start with among a few types. Upon the surface of planets and in orbit, you can spread your dominion and destroy or enslave all those in your wake. It is by all accounts a good all-around space 4x, there are however issues.
Planetary armies are nigh irrelevant, larger ships take forever to build, and wars are consequently won after one side has had most of their fleet destroyed. In most other Paradox 4x games, there's often the possibility to rise from the ashes and put up another round or more of force against your enemy once you've lost but not here. Exceptionally weak stations in orbit of a planet are the only source of ship construction and can easily all be destroyed before you get more than a destroyer or two out. Without the ability to build a navy from a planetary surface or use ground-to-orbit weaponry, victory is pretty much completely based on fleet strength.
In time I'm sure patches and expansions will smooth out combat issues but for now, its a good concept that pretty much makes anything but genocidal hegemonic empires simply incapable of maintaining a serious presence on the galactic stage.			"

With no diplomacy, not politics, no internal storylines, Stellaris as is, is just a bore.			"
281990,Jackal326,19,30,0,True,35.7,May 23,"In truth I wasn't sure what to expect from 'Stellaris'.
I've played RTS games such as 'Company of Heroes' and turn-based games such as the 'Civilisation' series before and somehow this game manages to merge the best of both worlds. It does this by combining the real-time (though pausable) orders system with a massively in-depth command and control element, not to mention the massive technology research trees that go from usuing simple thrusters on your ships to navigate your system to FTL-drives for inter-galaxy travel.
This game takes a while to get into, but it does have an optional tutorial system built in that will explain what each screen does, and introduce you to many of the deeply-involving facets of the game. Its by no means an EASY game to get into - you aren't going to be taking over the galaxy within the first 10 minutes, but if you can afford to put time into a game such as this, I feel you'll find it deeply rewarding. I've only spent ~5hrs with it so far, and I certainly enjoy it.
Pros:Widely customisable : You can not only crate your own faction and name it what you like, but you can also set traits that will affect how other space-faring civilisations view you - whether it be as a xenophobic human military-dictatorship (my current build) or as a plant-based pacifist race. You are also able to customise and design your own ships using technology you research to outfit them with the fastest engines and most-powerful weaponry.
Huge scope: Starting a new game allows you to determine the size of the galaxy (as well as many other options). The galaxy my current game has currentlyt holds ~1000 star systems, with each system holding on average 5 or 6 planetary bodies (some habitiable, some only useful for their resources).
Cons:Only worth getting if you can afford to sink a lot of time into. I'm 5 hours in and am barely scratching the surface. As I said above its a slow game to get into, but I feel it is becoming a rather rewarding experience.
10/10 - Not a game for everyone, as many prefer the faster-pace offered by other genres, but if you're a strategy fan then words cannot convey how much I recommend this game. "

I'm enjoying the game and I think it's pretty fun but consider it Early Access, 
this was a rushed release but I'm sure that 15$ DLCs + 5$ Content packs every 3 months will fix it.
Not recommended because this is not ""an evolution of the grand strategy genre"" as they want to sell it, there is nothing of a GS:
Stellaris is just a decent 4X Game made by Paradox in the Clausewitz engine.
It's $CURRENT_YEAR and ""Grand Strategy"" is probably going to be the new buzzword for any game with a big map and a lot of entities interacting with each other.

281990,76561198099885202,80,145,2,False,45.3,May 19,"This is my first and hopefully last review, that I 'll ever write for steam. The general ratings you find on steam are typically trustworthy, unfortunately Stellaris does not follow suit. Before I go any further, may I say for the record, that I have shown ferverous support for Paradox. I have well over 1200 hours played on Ck2 and over 500 on EU4. Within 40 hours of playing Stellaris, I was dumbfounded by how unfinished of a product this truly is. The tiny intricate marvels the player experiences within the first half of the game become irrelevant by the time Big powers have become established. Races, Politics, decision making, even research, becomes almost arbitrary. The game boils down to how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ships do you have in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ death congolomerate and how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ships do the other powers have in theirs. Paradox has never been known for detailed combat sequences, which I have always been okay with. Combat was never a major focus, for the majority of the titles they put out. Stellaris was not meant to be one of paradox's few excepetions. Unforatuntely the game becomes too restricted, in all facets of the word space, that the last half of the game ends up you declaring mind numbing wars for the however many hours it takes you to win.
  In addition, There are tons of bugs. Just to name a few, 
Missing armies - If a war ends and you have armies stuck on a planet that you do not own, they end up ""dissappearing"". They will still show up on the side panel, and you will still have to pay upkeep for them, but you are unable to locate them and or disband them. 
  Never Growing Pops-. There is a feature in the game in which you may allow your pops to freely migrate from planet to planet, not only within the confines of your empire, but other space empires if you so make an agreement with said parties. What ends up happening is, a pop of a particular race will move to your planet and then say ""eh, this place ♥♥♥♥ing sucks"" and leaves a solid 3 minutes later. once the pop gets there it starts to ""Reproduce"". a sillouhette will appear in a production slot of said species, but won't produce anything till it's fully grown. when the original pop migrates away. the shadow pop will stop growing because there are no more members of the same species on that planet. Instead of the shadow pop dissapearing it stays there stuck on 0.0 growth. 
    Gene mutation - ♥♥♥♥ed, ♥♥♥♥ed, ♥♥♥♥ed. ♥♥♥♥ed.
The interface, is also really ♥♥♥♥ing clunky. It's extremely unfriendly and I constantly find myself saying ""why wouldn't they do this a different way"" It seems as though it was an afterthought. Unfinished, much like the rest of the game.
That being said, there are some wonderful features. tons of intricacies that will literally help you forget all the other ♥♥♥♥ the game has been throwing in your face. The initial option of race/ empire creation is extremely detailed. It allows the player to really immerse him/herself into the game before it's even begun. It allows for a full range of motion in choosing a player's species' ideologies, short comings and strengths. 
Early game alien interactions, research and discovery are also incredibly detailed and really help guide the game without it feeling too restricted.
I just feel that, after spending 40 hours playing Stellaris and witnessing such an unfinished game, that I cant help but think that Paradox is taking full advantage of a loyal fanbase. This game was pegged as being one of the most colossal games they have ever released, and so far it seems as though they put such little time into it. I'm sure Paradox will fix it, but how many DLC's and expansions will I need to buy? How many mods will I need to download? I'm sorry, but for anyone who is thinking of buying this game, realize that despite paying 40 dollars for this game, you will not recieve a product worth the money in return.

281990,76561198007765941,6,6,0,True,35.5,May 10,"I began the game using a custom made civilization of my own design, the United Sicaren Compact. I was able to choose a variety of factors that helped mould my would be space empire: my people's ethics, the style of government, what kind of world they inhabited, and so on and so forth. 
Soon I was happy with the empire I had created and began my game in a galaxy of 600 stars, one empire among many all set on galactic domination. As a fanatically militaristic society, the United Sicaren Compact immediately set out to exploiting the resources of my home system and the stars surrounding it. As my burgeoning fleet grew ever larger, I came into contact with another empire very much like my own, the Bloc of Garan'Ferpi. Our relationship did not start off well and we spent several years hurling insults at each other across the vastness of space. However, my fleets were becoming larger, my armies more deadly, and so I decided to throw more than insults at the aliens.
My conquest of the Galan'Ferpi was swift, and I ground them beneath my heel, offering them a chance to be my vassal or die. They chose subservience. With my newly acquired, and extremely discontent, servant nation, I set my sights on another empire, the Haahn Cartel. These birdmen were nothing but traders and diplomats. Their fleets were nothing compared to my own or that of my vassal. The Haahn also became my slaves.
So encouraged by my massive successes, I chased war after war throughout the galaxy. The United Sicaren Compact was a force unstoppable by the rest of the galaxy's empires! Nation after nation fell to my fleet and the number of my vassals grew swiftly!
My ego became engorged by my successes, and soon I no longer scouted my potential prey before declaring war and descending upon them. I came upon another empire, the Usanace Forerunners. To me, they were another empire I assumed would fall easily considering they only had two systems colonized. My fleets in position, I declared war and summoned my vassals to my side. However, I was not prepared for what awaited me. As soon as the declaration was sent warning sirens blared at me of danger. Somehow my own systems were already under attack, despite their being half the galaxy away! As my own fleet materialized in the Usanace Forerunner's system, I saw that I was doomed. Their fleets were far more numerous than mine and their ships vastly more powerful. At my empire's capital, a massive fleet had appeared as though they had always been there and laid waste to my space stations and planetary fortifications.
My fleet was lost in seconds, my planets' infrastructure destroyed with nary a thought. The Usanace Forerunners had crushed me like the impudent whelp I was. They demanded my surrender, which I was forced to accept considering my situation. However, they were not done with me. As soon as the leader of the United Sicaren Compact, my own avatar, signed the surrender, he was viciously assassinated by the very same people who had forced him to sign it.
My fleets gone and my empire in shambles, I tried to rebuild what I had lost. However, within a year my vassals began to rise up against me, one after another, as they fought for independence. I had no chance and I was crushed beneath the weight of my own hubris.
This was just my first playthrough of Stellaris. I await eagerly the story that will unfold in my next playthrough!			"
281990,76561198009311495,6,6,0,True,94.3,May 11,"Very polished. It's a Paradox game, you can be assured of that. And you know what, I'm going to reccommend this game because there's sadly not a whole lot of polished space strategy games out there, and this one is certainly worth taking a peek at. 
HOWEVER, and I suggest you read this... (EDIT: Added a list of things below if you're into reading ;)
The game would have you believe this is a very indepth space strategy game about cultivating an alien civilization. And... sure, it is. But it feels less like a grand strategy and more like a somewhat shallow 4X game. 
The biggest issue at this point is simply that the only way to 'play' or 'win' the game right now is the expand and or conquer. Literally- those are the only winning conditions. 
Which wouldn't be an issue, but military conquest and alliance making is literally the entire mid to end game. The game is surprisingly shallow once you hit that stage, and don't expect to build a race focused on amassing wealth via complex trade like the Ferengi, or silently striking with espionage like the Romulans... there just aren't any mechanics for it. You're either making a race that likes to build alliances, or a race that likes to conquer people. 
But I'm still reccomending the game, because it's still a solid game. And it's a great CORE game, and I can guarantee you Paradox will flood you with DLCs adding new mechanics into the game to really bring it to life, and allow you to play it as you want.
_________________________________________________________________________
WHAT NEEDS FIXING (will update):
- Improved AI, so it can better control its fleets especially during war-time. 
- Improved ally AI, as right now allies do not think independently and instead simply follow your largest fleet about. AI also needs to consider other members of the alliance when suggesting a war, which currently it doesn't. 
- Various bugs need a fix'n. 
WHAT THE GAME NEEDS: 
- Trade system. Setting up physical trade routes, consdering various goods made by your own empire and xeno cultures, PIRACY and space pirates, that sort of stuff. Indepth economy. 
- Improved diplomacy options, especially in conversing and suggesting things to allies. Things like ""attack X planet"" or ""follow X fleet"". 
- World generation options. Need more galaxy shapes, an advanced start option, and reaaally need to be able to turn off biased world generation (if you're playing an ocean planet specieis, a good three to four systems around you will always be full of ocean planets). 
- More victory conditions relating to something other than conquering or intergrating other races. 
WHAT THE GAME COULD DO WITH (maybe DLC?):
- Espionage! Cloaking technology! Romulans, baby! 
- Hell, even religion would have a place due to the fanatical space races in the game. 
- Scouting ships, physical envoys, more ship roles. 
- Possibilities are endless.			"

There are a few AI quirks that need to be fleshed out, but given the scale of this game I'd say it's to be expected. This game is a shining example as to why Paradox is my favorite developer: They clearly give a ♥♥♥♥. Stellaris is exactly the 4X space game I've been waiting for.			"
281990,76561198023347160,6,6,0,True,41.1,May 10,"I can't recommend this game enough.
I haven't played nearly enough to give a proper review in full but I want to endorse the game while sharing my first impressions. 
The atmosphere, the music, the graphics, the game flow, everything feels really solid. I've always wanted to get into one of these space empire building games but none of them have ever really done it for me. This game I picked up and couldn't put down until I went to bed. These days I'm lucky if a game can hold my attention for more than a few hours yet I found myself laying awake last night planning out my next big move that my empire would need to take in the morning.
This game nails the perfect balance between 4X and grand strategy. It's much easier to get into and understand than any of Paradox's previous grand strategy titles yet it still has the same depth that fans of the genre love. If you have ever had any interest in playing a grand strategy title, this is the perfect game to start with.
The developer has also stated that they are going to be supporting the mod scene in a major way so I expect to see some really cool conversions similar to Crusader Kings 2 : Game of Thrones mod, (imagine Star Wars, Warhammer 40K, Star Trek etc).
Basically it's the best space empire game on the market and more importantly perhaps it is a fantastic platform on which to build future content whether it be mods or official DLC.
If you're on the fence get off it. 
- ""Review"" Update - 
I've played the game for another full day (so sick poor me) and my first campaign was so interesting I thought it was worth updating my review for.
Allies. Love my space buddies. In most of these kinds of video games your allies don't seem to care about you. At best they won't attack for a time or even if they do ""decide to join your war"" you may only ever see a single small unit not even contributing.
NOT SO HERE. I was a science focused civ and as it turns out my 2 alien neighbors were too. We saw eye to eye on some things and decided to form a 3 civ alliance. Eventually I got bored and that's when things with the AI got interesting.
I attacked. I expected to be alone in it but nope, my allies sent their full force by my side into every battle I waged. They were relentless. After I saw the ferocity of my 2 allies sending their full might against my designated enemies I grew much bolder and conquered everything in sight.
Now before you go to war you must decide on your goals (who gets which planet etc). Normally I'd say screw the AI I'll take it all but when my allies have a vote in it, and they actually help me, I'm totally cool with throwing them a planet or two.
I love my space neighbors. We have fought many wars together and we have all become strong.

281990,76561198062930115,7,8,0,True,95.5,May 9,"I cant help myself but give this game the thimbs up - and I am going to list the good about it immediately. 2.5 hours in and over 60 more watching youtubers like Arumba, Quill, AngryJoe and of course, Paradox, I do not see much bad about the game apart from a number of bugs, more customization options and the start of the game - someone can get a way more favorable one than the rest. I know I restarted 3 times and 1 of those was WAY better than the other two.
So this is what I really liked about the game so far:
- I LOVE the initial exploration phase. Sending multiple science and war ships to unlock systems and thoroughly scan them for habitable planets and resources is extremely fun and totally scratches my itch for discovery and going where no man has gone before.
- I LOVE how easy it is to get into the game. Granted, I might have had help by watching the youtubers, but I could totally get into the gameplay without any hiccups, unlike Paradox's other Grand Strategies EU4 or CK2, where I was totally overwhelmed, even to the point of leaving them back for a long time.
- I LOVE the freedom the game gives you. You can play with a pre-made civilizazion, or make your own the way you feel like, which is what I did. I totally recommend people do that - it is so much fun mixing and matching stuff and testing them out. You can be a warmonger, pacifist, mercantilist, mogul, expansionist, whatnot!
- I LOVE how the playthroughs can differ from one another. In my 3 starts, I had 3 totally different experiences, based on resources, events, encounters, galaxy composition, star composition, etc. JUST AWESOME!
- I LOVE how everything you do feels IMPORTANT and not even remotely boring.
- I LOVE how choices have meaningful continuations - not like Civilization Beyond Earth for example, where everything resulted in similar outcome. Here you can either continue a quest line, stop a quest line, drive it to a conclusion that gives you various rewards, and so on.
- I like how you get to customize everything after you start. You can let the game guide your hand or go completely wild with your own ship designs, options, and whatnot.
- I like the new research system. Stellaris breaks the mold by allowing you multiple research topics at once, which amounts to crazy amounts of research options, based on anything you find through events, dead alien bodies, destryoned alien ships, and so on.
- I like how everything in your empire can level up and improve - your admirals, planetary governors, scientists, everything but the little settlers levels up and gets more and more useful as the game goes on.
- I like how you are NOT put into a level playing field. Every race has it forte's, and some have been in space way longer than you, which makes them way too overpowered. Like Q in Star Trek.
- I like how you can just play the game and have fun.
- I like how you can easily make friends and enemies.
- I like how the game both holds your hand through quests and missions, but at the same time, does not impose itself on you and lets you do it your way.
- I like how the tutorial helps you as you go, not with simple tips, pre-made missions, or pre-made scenarios that have nothing to do with a real game.
Conclusion: Paradox did it again - they proved themselves as a developer that carefully chooses its games and drives them to perfection. This games does it all for me - it scratches every itch I may have: exploration, development, diversity, diplomacy, variety, engaging play, everything. I expect dumping hundreds of hours into this game, and pray I have the time for that...			"

281990,doomwarrior,7,8,0,True,278.9,May 9,"TLDR: 
What a gem in the making... lovely, enjoyable, stable even in Mp, still a bit rough around the edges but all in all, worth the money.
Here a few more details from our 16ppl. Multiplayer Release Session:
It started out a bit rough, we couldnt get half the group in since we were using a password protected server. Once we removed the apparently buggy password, it worked like a charm for hours until very early in the morning when the hype train came to a slow stop when nearly everybody was falling asleep because we played the crap out of the game. 
And boy did everyone enjoy this. There was no dissappointment in our group. We started out as noobs and within just a few hours we sent fleets of 10k strength out to conquer, massive battles happened and empires got hammered. We even roleplayed our societies and alien nature to a degree. The Game invites you to do it, its just a lot of fun to do it.
Here are some pros and cons:
The game starts out relatively slow. The first 1-2 hours are nice nonetheless cause of the exploration, the discoveries, the endless storylines and the research that enlightens you. But you dont really know whatÂ´s happening. There is no techtree you can look up to plan the best way to research and expand. You literally have to explore it. And it was pretty different for all of us. People in Teamspeak were constantly talking about stuff they researched which others never saw and didnt understand...cause it was fundamentally different from what they experienced....within the same game.
The Game was stable the entire time. We had a few crashes for a few guys, for whatever reason but the majority was able to play and the server never crashed. Hotjoining works like a charm, admin can allow new guys to hotjoin or kick them out. It does not disturb the gameflow. (unlike civ, where it stopped the game). It feels kind of well thought through and polished in that regard.
Graphics are beautifull and bring the universe to life. Its the little things that make this game so nice. Supported with the storytelling its just so immersive. You feel like you are in a universe with a history. Stuff you find is thousands, sometimes millions of years old.
The Soundtrack is just freakin brilliant. People in our Server on Teamspeak were enjoying it a hell of a lot. It didnt disturb, it made you feel well and you were still able to play, talk, relax and enjoy the game. What else can you expect?
Here are a few cons:
Sometimes, even though the UI is already well done, the game gets a bit tedious. For example your groundforces have to be managed manually one by one. You will need around 20-30 of them for an invasion. Now you go to a planet, recruit them and now each one of them can be equipped... enjoy the clickfest. Each one needs to be selected, outfitted again and again and again...and then you send them out, select their ships and move them to...whereever. Its tedious, crap and annoying and in dire need of an optimization in the UI. 
Revolts seem to be a bit out of balance. Imagine, your fleet just bombed the living hell out of a planet, you killed the defence, took it over, win the war...take the planet as your price and now what? People get unhappy, join a faction, declare war on you and spawn like a gazillion troops. Ofc, those are amazing, kick you in the face and throw you out. It took me 5 planets on full production of groundforces and several attemps to take 1 of 2 revolting planets back. I had to bring around 20-30 Groundtroops for a revolt... something you can take an entire empire with.
Other than that, the game feels well balanced, nicely done and none of us really wanted to stop playing. But we were already falling  asleep so we HAD to stop.
Damn you body, for being to weak to play and demanding sleep. Cant you see im hyped? ;-)

281990,76561198205940007,8,10,3,True,30.4,May 19,"All seemed well, my collectivist, slave making, genocidal master race was doing awesome. I purged many of the peasant alien races one by one, and anyone else who dared to speak against me, even my fleet admirals and scientists (ok they don't actually do that ingame but I take my roleplaying srsly gais). The majority of the galaxy was mine, only two factions left. 
There was the empire west of the galactic center, they lost many colonies, but they hadn't lost their will to resist. There was also another empire to the east of the galactic center, secluded by a Nebula. Because I am pretty much a God, I attack both at the same time. The battle against the western empire resulted in a loss, their coordinated point defence systems had my missles on lockdown, something which I did not anticipate. My laser equipped ships did enough damage to halt any sort of immediate follow up strike, but the remainder of my fleet required extensive repairs after initiating an emergency tacticool runawaywarp. The war in the east was even worse. The Nebula cloud slowed down my FTL warp travel, and because I decided to split the fleet into many fleetlings and attack from all sides, the jumps were very poorly coordinated. One fleetling jumped in after another had been completely obliterated by their defence platforms and ships. It was painful to watch, but then it hit me. Watching my severly underpowered 2K fleetings get their FTL drives stuck up their crewmen excrement ejector by 15K+ fleets reminded me of my galactic genocidal conquest. 
I bought this game to play, but I ended up feeling instead when I realised that I had pretty much been roleplaying Stalin's third reich of the rising sun. Tears streaked down my eyes as I watched my empire slowly break apart. This is what it felt like to have things taken away from you, to have your people enslaved by other people. One by one colonies fell, people rebelled and my leaders at the ripe young age of 200 years old began dying. I just sat there, staring at my home planet. Earth was beautiful, her deep blue oceans and earthy earth was the envy of the galaxy. My will to fight had been reignited.
I rapidly built many defence platforms around the Sol system, made new battleships specifically designed to defend the OG waifu, Earth, and hired new fleet admirals. Then... I waited. (This is the part where they stopped trying to kill me out of empathy but I made them want to kill me again because it would be a cooler story). Sure enough, they came. Missles flew, cannons spewed, lasers pierced the darkness, and joint fighters filled the spaces inbetween as the defence of Sol became a reality. Wave after wave of ships forced me into learning how to micro-manage seperate ships to coordinate repairs, upgrades and tacticool decisions in order to fight at full efficiency. The waves would not stop, the fighting continued for several years, until finally they destroyed one of the defence platforms and punctured a hole in my inpenetrable wall. It set off a chain reaction, my wall began to crumble, until there was only the Earth ground defence army left. Huge fleets moved in and bombarded Earth with no remorse. Invasion fleets creeped in after the big bois and landed on her soil. With our fortifications destroyed and moral at an all time low, she fell in a matter of weeks. 
I had lost not only the game, but my heart as well. At that point I decided to go to bed. It was 5AM, and I cried myself to sleep, not because I had an important ethics test which I didn't study for the next day, but because of this game. :'(/10, never roleplaying again.			"

281990,asgeirom,29,50,3,False,38.0,May 13,"TLDR: Fleet combat system ruins the fun and several aspects of the game.
At writing the 13.4 hours represent my second game, my first game (~6 hours) was at a friends, and I loved it.
The research/tech system is one that most Master of Orion fans will like, the game has 3 research/tech categories. You will be presented a choice in all categories [number of options varies]. When you've completed a research the choices in that category get randomized, meaning you get to pick only between a few of the available research topics. It works well, for making new games different. However there is a problem:
Combat currently consists of your fleets getting ""locked"" in combat, and you are no longer able to control the ships. So for my second game, when I had focused on long range, large, fast moving ships [no armor and/or shield]. I got completely destroyed, even though I had 185% the range and 130% engine speed.
So if you don't mind that there is a [definitive] right way to play this game, and that you might get the wrong research options repeatedly: you'll have a great time.
I think that for the first time they really messed up, I mean EU4 wasn't great on release, but it wasn't this much of a mess.			"
281990,rogers1335,10,14,0,True,26.1,May 22,"Stellaris is really my first venture into true 4x games. To be honest I have 
so much apprehension to this genre it has always kept me away. I used to
watch my friends sink hundreds of hours in Crusader Kings, and Europa
Universalis 4 and they seemed to love it. I was always sitting in the back 
thinking, “I don’t want to have to go back to school practically to learn a
video games mechanics and the finer points of the game before I can give
it a try. 
     So I picked up Stellaris the newest title by Paradox and as someone 
who is new and was previously intimidated by 4x, I can say with confidence
the game is quite excellent and above all accessible! The game features
a great level of customization from everything about planet management
(buildings, policies, upgrades) to individual ship designs (weapons, power,
shielding) as well as empire customization (leader traits, government style,
military tech start, etc) The game allows for you to custom tailor your star
fairing race to a fine point. As well as the finer details of micromanagement
and creating sectors to manage planets under one “system/sector” so 
that takes a bit of the stress off the individual micro of planets. 
     The game features a beautiful aesthetic barring performance issues at
this moment of writing it. Giant space battles and honestly when Civs start
growing and filling the map you are going to see a frame hit. I am running
a 980ti… so there are things left to be desired in terms of game performance
but I have heard they are hard at work fixing these optimization problems. 
so I do have faith Paradox will work hard on fixing the issues that are affecting
the game currently. They also have given full mod support to the community
so expect some amazing mods and total conversions (BSG,MassEffect,Star
Wars,Star Trek, etc). Stellaris has a lot it got right and it made it fun for me
to learn and to challenge myself to manage my empire better. 
     The game features fun random events that can be great for your empire
or not so great. It also features a random tech tree so you really won't have
the same options a second time in the order you get them in say your first
game. Which I personally enjoy, take Civ5 for example with an incredibly
linear tech tree, having a random tech tree with “rare” tech etc spices things
up and encourages you to play differently and focus on what you need or
are going for rather than following the same path over and over again. It 
adds variety and fun challenges to your empires rise and potential fall. 
     I could talk about the game all day to be honest but I think I will try to
keep this someone concise. Stellaris may be Paradox’s best 4x game yet.
I have a new genre to enjoy and sink massive hours into. This is an easy
recommend to veterans of 4x/Paradox games, and even a recommend
for those trying to get into this genre. It’s fun, accessible, and addictive! 
 
 "
281990,76561198016806109,21,35,0,False,55.8,May 12,"Been playing for almost 10 hours now, and let me be honest, I REALLY enjoy this game. All those funny stories you see on many positive reviews, yes those are pretty much accurate. And being a game from Paradox, it has a lot of influences from their Grand Strategy, although my minor nitpick is that they dumbed it down to appeal to 4X players, but that's just me.
The main reason I gave this a thumbs down is that although this game is extremely polished, this game is incomplete (you can read other negative reviews to see what they are). They should have had 2 more months of development - but the good thing is that it will definitely get 2 more months of development. Paradox never stops working on their games (however, they also don't know when to stop, or just don't want to stop, after what we've seen from the unnecessary, ahistorical, and almost game-breaking updates they've added to CK2 and EU4, but this is beside the point).
If you're a hardcore Paradox fan that's been following this game for months, buying it full price now isn't all that bad. But to the players new to Paradox games, hardcore 4X players, and casuals, this game is not at its full potential yet. Wait for a sale or until they've added bug fixes (whichever comes first), or maybe even until the first DLC comes out, because as of now people who've played this game religiously since the minute it came out have already seen everything this game has to offer, and even for me after 10 hours it's becoming stale.
I will eventually change this into a thumbs up after the game has gone through the necessary changes.
I see a bunch of elitists who keep ranting about how Distant Worlds is better, and I won't argue that it isn't, but don't underestimate Paradox's ability to literally triple a game's content/complexity, revamp the UI, and fix thousands of bugs through DLCs. And don't say ""DLC is content that should have been in the base game in the first place"" because this isn't a full price game, $40. The difference between Paradox games and every other strategy game is that Paradox will continuously add new content and quality-of-life updates to their games for at least the next 4 years. Not many strategy games do that, sometimes they just release a sequel. But Stellaris won't need a sequel for a long time. Eventually maybe after 3 or 4 DLCs Stellaris could be a competent competitor to Distant Worlds. Don't quote me on that.
Yes, everyone knows Paradox is ruthless when it comes to DLCs. But as long as the DLC isn't game breaking like Conclave or overpriced like The Cossacks, then it's worth the money (but still, I'd recommend waiting for sales).
EDIT: Also - Sectors. F**king sectors. They are probably the most helpful thing in the game, in theory, but they just don't work and are extremely buggy. Paradox has put out 3 big patches but none address the sector system. In my opinion, disregard other patches for now. Until they finally fix the horrid sector system, this review will stay negative.

281990,guls,13,20,0,False,27.4,May 12,"Stellaris has a strong base to build on: good control core (playing in real time requires some getting used to but it works), good expansion/management gameplay, and pretty graphics that you don't expect to see in a game like this one. 
Sadly it fails at so many other things, and particularly the whole diplomacy and trading side of things which becomes very important mid-game is so opaque and frustrating, with a terrible UI coming with it, that it can ruin an entire game.
Let's hope that Paradox will get to improve this part with expansions, but for the time being it's hard to recommend the game.			"
281990,76561198129948714,66,121,0,False,86.1,May 21,"I do not recommend buying this game at this point. I just lacks flavor and most playthroughs feel the same. Midgame is pretty empty and galaxy conquest becomes annoying once you built up some aggression with your enemies who'll all join the same alliance so taking a planet is going to net you relatively few war score and it's going to take forever to win the wars which oftentimes lack major engagements, because the AI is literally programmed to run from you unless they outnumber you 1.5:1 which is rarely the case. This all ties in with the lack of meaningful late game diplomacy. 
All in all you'll probably enjoy a single blob playthough and then start with a couple of different empires to realize it will all mostly play out the same anyways and the fact that the government and ethics are kinda imbalanced like playing xenophics is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when collectivists get the straight up better bonuses, techs and buildings. They've already mentioned it in the patchnotes, but to repeat it: Ethic convergence is annoying as ♥♥♥♥ and can barely be countered besides choosing conformist at the start of the game with a fat 20% bonus. ♥♥♥♥ like this cripples playstyles due to min/max concerns on my part. Start as xenophobic to see how by 2250 over 50% of your population is xenophile...

281990,76561198006851210,67,123,4,False,47.8,May 12,"Long time Paradox fan but this new entrant does not (in my opinion) match up to the hype. 
There is a lot of new and shiny to grab the attention initially, but it is all very shallow. 
1. Combat:  This is just a ""bigger number wins"" with very little player input.
2. Diplomacy is basically non-existent. As AI is notoriously difficult to programme well in a fluid negotiating system Paradox have gone for the easier route of ""The only deal the AI is going to agree to is massively one-sided in their favour"". Irrespective of supposed species/cultural preferences. This means they can avoid the AI making stupid deals by forcing the payer to make them instead.
3. Planet development/ Empire Development: Build stuff, research new stuff, build that. Very little so far to make each planet feel unique after the intial clearance/settlement. Some minor balancing of resource generation.....
4. War/Conquest: There seem to be a lot of artificial barriers to carrying out a war of conquest. You can only capture X number of planets before the war finishes, no war after that for Z years with same faction, integration very slow etc etc. Some of these may be realistic but I have the terrible suspicion that they were put there to prevent a good player (not me) from steamrolling and winning too quickly. 
All in all I found myself too often playing on ""Fast"" or ""Fastest"" waiting for the next bit of research, planet development.
Conclusion: Shallow 4x light that is disappointing given its creators. However your enjoyment may differ and hopefully patches will add some depth!

281990,urquanster,48,87,3,False,85.5,May 24,"The game is very unfinished. It has VERY solid base and ton of potential. Even in this state there's much fun to be had. I'm not even against a heavy-DLC model that would bloat up the price to 90-100$ since Paradox was one of my favorite developers and I was always happy to support them.
However pandering to SJW bigots and pulling mods off the workshop, because they ""might be offensive"" to some gender studies weirdo or the thumblr special snowflake is unforgivable. I'm sorry, Paradox, but I'll never buy anything from you again. It's sad to see that your managment lost their mind and that you don't know your playerbase.

As a paradox fan, I looked forward to this game, so I bought it as soon as I had the chance.
I instantly fired up the multiplayer mode, and created my own civilization.
I spent a good 20-30 minutes in the creator, just thinking about how I want my species to grow in the universe.
After being done with the civ creation we finally were able to start the game. Well we spent another good 10-30 minutes in the first second being paused, as we tried to decipher the things before us. It was a great help, that the full tutorial AI explained everything we clicked on in detail. After mostly figuring out what is what, we started time, and begun to survey the galaxy. Everything started out a bit slow and shaky, but when we got used to the controls it all started to fit in place. After a few hours of gaming you could clearly see the difference me and my friend represent. He with the humans, focusing on expansion and advanced ships, while myself focusing on high level resource management, and fast but precise exploration. To end this wall of text, I think the game is very well able to fit your requirements of an empire you established.
This is only my first expression, I'll make sure to put more hours in the game and provide a more deep, fact based analyis.

=========================
Ive clocked 43 hours, played 2 single player campaign, played 2 multiplayer games (1 with a close friend againts AI, and 1 with 20 random human players -clocked about 6 hours per mp game)
Putting few more hours in this game makes me realize improvements can be made in term of User Interface. Once you have a huge empires with 5 sectors and 100 planets, you find yourself performing repetitive clicking to perform one single thing. I thought the point of having sectors is so that micromanagement are no longer needed whislt you focus on building your fleet.
Online experience 
- in battle, its pretty hard to coordinate with your team - steam chat is a must, the built in chat system sucks so bad
- notification and awareness - i dont know if my ally is getting attacked, i dont know where theyre getting attack. if only there was a Ping command (like RA2/LoL)
AI is very very dumb and you can exploit that to your advantage.
But I still recommend the game. Replayability is a pro. Wait for more DLC and community mods to make this game more interstellar.

Bought the game last night. Played tutorial for 2 hours. Went to bed.
Came home after work and had a quick nap. Restart a new game. Clocked 7 hours.
I spent the first 6 hours expanding, researching  and met 2 alien life forms. One was nice, and the other one was a ♥♥♥♥. I tried to be nice, but the ♥♥♥♥ alien insulted me. Expanded into one of his nearby territory and he declared war on me. The 7th hour, I spent my time building an army, Destroyers and Attack ships.

I love the simplicity of tech research, attacking without micromanagement, simple UI.

281990,Impsmash,6,7,0,True,34.2,May 9,"Salutations fellow gamers!
I just wanted to write a quick first impressions review of Stellaris so far. I am only 3 hours into it so far but so far its been great! I have a good number of RTS and 4x strategy games. Only a few of them are Paradox Interactive games such as Mount and Blade, War of the Roses, Magicka, King Arthur Strategy Game, and of course now is Stellaris. My class mates have been talking it up for the past few weeks and enticed me to finally get it on release day and I am very pleased with it.
For a strategy game it is very fluid yet methodical. When I say this I am thinking in my mind that this is a slight hybrid of Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion (both of which are great). Yet, this game is fluid without turns and you can even adjust the time to even pausing the game. This also is in effect in multiplayer but more on that later.
________________________________________________________________________________
Cost: It varies on what edition you get of the game, I personally got the Nova edition because it comes with a portrait species (literally only cosmetic, no effects on gameplay apart from just an alien spider like Arthropod archetype species) as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack is definitely worth the extra cost for its great quality and good atmosphere. Though for those who are into the game alone then just get the base game, the upper tiers of editions are really only cosmetic and support of the developers (along with social goodies such as forum badges, though that may I have changed by now). I would say for the quality of game it is in right now, it is worth the $50 I spent for the Nova edition.
Gameplay is rather unique and I do not think I gave it justice by implying it was a hybrid of Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire because it is a really interesting and great style of play. Generally speaking it is just like any other RTS where you develop your empire and encounter other species with differing responses. The empire creator by the way is wonderful and very finite, with editing the style of government and its ethics (all very compliced and not going into it with this first impressions, essentially just traits of your empire but could have different styles based on choices. There are a specific trait system that balances out with negatives and positives, much like Zomboid character traits, etc.) All in all the gameplay is typical for anyone who has played an RTS/4x game and I had no problem picking up the mechanics within the first 10-20 minutes.
Multiplayer is very interesting because supposedly it can go beyond 32 players (not recommended for ease of play). It is very simple to play with friends and even random people, though I would sit down prior and create your own empire if you so choose to rather than making everyone wait. The only gripe I have with multiplayer is that the thing I mentioned about controlling time is available to everyone (no clue if there is a host option to limit power or not). So at first people were pausing and slowing/speeding time up for EVERYONE so we had to set up some ground rules. All in all very fluid, my friends experienced minor lag problems but nothing hindering playability (could've been my friend's crappy internet hosting).
For a game that I never heard about until the last few weeks, it is a suprisingly great game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good RTS/4x game much like Endless space/etc. If you have friends than more the merrier because I've been enjoying playing with them quite a bit. This has been my first impressions and I give it a good thumbs up! :)

281990,76561198051551071,7,9,0,False,18.1,June 20,"Dear developers. Sorry. This is the Most. Boring. Game. Ever. Really, it is just a bunch of timers trying to be interesting. When the timer ends, you choose a new timer. And the UI seems designed to keep you busy. BORING. And the wars. Fighting wars with this system sucks. I fight a war, and the other guys can suddenly declare peace? What? 
What could be done to make it better? 
1. Make the consequences of choices actually clear, now there are so many choices it is totally unclear what does what. It just doesn't seem to matter much. 
2. Restructure the AI so you get away from micromanaging timers and into strategy. Now a lot of time is spent finding that particular planet back, etc. That is stuff the computer should do for you. I want to think about how to kill the other empire. Another thing the computer should do: show me what would happen to the border if I would place a frontier outpost. What will the influence be? That makes it less guesswork. If you get some feedback you can easily spend a lot of  more interesting time planning how to best expand the borders.
3. Why do I only see what planets are habitable in the galaxy map when I have a colony ship selected? Please make a 'colony planner view' or something that will show that. Or use overlays. 
4. If a trade ends, why is there no button that allows you to propose the trade again. Now I need to manually keep a list of what I trade with whom. Many such examples.
5. Please show me a tech tree so I can plan what research to pick. Or at least a 'general direction' tech tree. 
6. For flavor, it would be nice to have some kind of 'history' that gets created while you play. Add some events '100 year existence of colony X' etc. Remember great leaders and scientists. Now they are just RNG strings. 
I could go on. 
For prospective buyers: If you want to skip spending a bunch of hours hoping that it will change beyond managing timers, don't buy it. If you like staying 'busy' pressing the occasional random upgrade, by all means go ahead. Or try Adventure Capitalist. It does the same thing but in a more interesting way.

Having pre-purchased so many titiles, I can almost guarantee that no other publishers than Paradox have fulfilled all their promises before release. Not Deep Silver, nor even Ubisoft (LOL). 
Some quick outline of the game after ~35hrs of playing with yet unfinished campaign (yes, the game progress really SLOW!)
The game feels unfamiliar at the beginning, but soon you'll grasp the essense of the game if you come from EU4 (aka very Clausewitz-ish)
Very huge galaxy. I went with midium size and I cannot guarantee I have explored all it has to offer
A lot to do and try early game, which I enjoy the most. Ship designer was initially a blast to me
Beautiful BGM, with nice British accent assistant
Met the first alien empire! I tried to be nice, but they are too scared. No, we wont send you to the laboratory...
The diplomacy was quite simple, kinda reminded me of Civilization-style diplomacy window. No infiltration, no coveting action, no... royal marriage??? I hope the diplomacy can be more detailed in later patches/DLCs
The game gets hard as I expand my empire. I have a great difficulty keeping the balance positive while fulfilling my gorgeous ambitions. Also micromanagement of each planet really reminded me of provincial management in EU4
The later it gets, the more similarity of EU4 I can find in this game. You start up weak, you farm, you research, you build navies, you either be aggressive or continue to farm on... until you are the only one in this galaxy
Great MOD support. I've been using a few now
In fact, I stopped playing DOTA for a few days just because I wanna spend just one more hour in game... 
Minor imba issues. Minor graphics glitches. Minor issue with the launcher. Few functions broken. Acceptable given the game's just released ~10d ago
*Maybe* less replayability in comparision with EU4?
In conclusion, the game is pretty stellar at this price. I hope they can polish it further and add more elements to the game (I know they will, through paid DLCs...)

281990,Serbpreme,9,13,2,True,164.4,May 13,"Allow me to preface this review by stating that Stellaris is an unfinished product. No matter how I or anyone else may feel about this game, be it positive or negative, this game was blatantly left unfinished by the developers at release. If you purchase this game, expect a host of features to be left in a foundational state that will necessitate the purchasing DLC for a ""full experience.""
AbstractStellaris is a procedurally generated science fiction strategy game, melding traits from both 4X and grand strategy. An empire/race builder launches the campaign, allowing you to design your primary species: appearance, physiological traits, ethics (which determine your empire's socio-political alignment), favored weapon type, ship/planet cosmetics, etc. Upon completing your empire, a galaxy is generated for you by means of several options (galaxy type, size, number of AI, etc.) and you begin your journey from the day your civilization develops faster-than-light spacefaring capability.
GraphicsThe Stellaris universe is simple but gorgeous. The galaxy is populated with a host of stars, beautifully detailed planets, craggy asteroid belts, vivid nebulae, and abyssal black holes. Dozens of fascinating and creative alien portraits populate the game's biosphere. The UI and other interface elements do need work, however. The empire building screen at game start suffers from an unnecessary amount of negative space. When in the campaign itself, several interfaces (such as the ship designer UI or the planet building screens) tend to either block the gameplay screen or suffer from ""too many buttons to click"" syndrome, requiring a large amount of slowed or paused gametime whilst you micromanage.
StoryThe storytelling capability in Stellaris is immense. In just under forty hours of gameplay, I've racked up a host of adventures in intergalactic politics, wars and general mechanical quirks. A key factor is the empire building capability - I love creating my own empires specifically designed for the AI and enabling them to appear in my campaigns. There's nearly unlimited of roleplaying potential here. The primary vehicle that drives the story are the event chains - overarching narratives that really drive your expansion and exploratory impetus throughout the early game, but unfortunately tend to drop off until the late game. Randomly generated late-game crises such as synth rebellion, extradimensional invaders and more can shake things up substantially in the late years of your campaigns.
GameplayAs stated, the early game of Stellaris is fantastic. Throughout multiple playthroughs, the sense of exploration and mystique never seems to go away as you set out into your galaxy for the first time. As you start to colonize more and more planets, delegate sectors and begin engaging in galactic-state politics, however, the game slows down and becomes even somewhat of a slog.
ConclusionAs it stands, Stellaris is an unfinished game with very promising potential, capability and strong mechanics for a foundation. Though undoubtedly it's my current favorite title because I can look past these flaws and see that it'll be built upon and made into a truly fantastic sci-fi experience, I can't quite recommend it to a casual or entry-level grand strategy gamer right yet. I recommend it wholly to Paradox veterans and people willing to look past the DLC model.
As a friend put it, Stellaris needs its ""Art of War"" (one of the key expansions for Europa Universalis IV which truly ""completed"" the game.) This pricing model of releasing a barebones product and reinforcing it with well over $150 in DLC is getting old and needs to be called out.

Just What is Stellaris Missing, Exactly? -- A Full List of Concepts to be Added and Quality of Life Fixes to be Made "
281990,longlongxt,9,13,0,False,49.1,June 25,"Current verdict (6/26/2016, version 1.1): No.
There are several things that you expect from a 4X and several things that you expect from Paradox when you keep in mind they've had ages perfecting their designs through Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, etc. So do they deliver?
The game as a 4X-title and what Paradox does best
Arguably one of the most important elements of this genre is missing. Expanding your empire only really happens through extermination, rarely if ever through diplomatic means. The method to do so is still as bland as in Europa Universalis. You vassalize and run down the clock, until you can click that magical button to integrate/annex. At least, EU still had some parameters to fulfil, make sure to match religion, realize that certain government types cannot be annexed through certain methods, and so on. There is something missing. It is something to worry about because diplomacy is generally not Paradox's strong suit. Can they still fix it?
This also holds true for exploration of both the map and technology. The first few runs in the game will be great. There are new events popping up, some funny, some great references and generally good stuff. However, as you increase the number of restarts you'll notice there are too few events. You will run the same quest lines over and over again with each and every one of your empires. And as the game drags on, fewer and fewer new events will pop up. Now this is very much fixable, since it just needs more time. And I fully expect this content to be (p)added. What is slightly worrysome though is how barebones it is compared to previous Paradox titles. If anything it feels rushed. (And even though I am not necessarily against DLC expansions, I have to say that I am slightly worried about how many DLC packs it's going to take to turn this into a living galaxy.)
What I do love about the game is the initial feeling. Setting up your own alien race, designing (get mods to add options though) your empire, and then starting out on a single planet,  it all feels great. You'll explore the system, and then warp to the next. The first time it feels exciting. Unfortunately this excitement comes down a little when you realize the AI is extremely passive, refuses most advanced trade agreements and is just not fun to deal with. They do each have their own  character traits (the same way you can set out to be a xenophobic militarist) but apart from the greeting messages they don't seem to actively pursue their own goals.
Can they fix it?
Now, they do have a seemingly solid foundation for the game. It looks quite good and I don't necessarily agree with others that the UI is horrible. It's quite similar to previous Paradox-titles, which have always been a bit cluttered. Certainly there are some things that should intuitively work that don't. (Mostly shortcuts like going to the planets overview and not being able to assign orders from there.) However, I think the UI-issues are mostly fixable, especially since mods have shown that it is possible to reduce the amount of nuisance.
My main concern is how they are going to fix the non-event based gameplay. Paradox is great at having event chains with interesting and funny dialogue but given the lack of a historical background between the empires there has to be more in there to keep the game flowing when it's not directed through events. Diplomacy needs a major overhaul and so does trading. There needs to be more activity in space. More rogue empires or rogue planets. Even if empires are not going to war with eachother as much, there still needs to be action. Especially planets far from the home system need to be more susceptible to revolt. Common threats in the galaxy only pop up near the end to ""finish"" the game. The most damning argument to Paradox having rushed the game is the fact that pirates only pop up once, and always at the same time, every playthrough. They spawn in a system close to you and then attack one of your stations. You kill them, and that's it. It almost feels like a placeholder event.
I am sure that people will disagree with me and say that Paradox is great, not at all like EA, Ubisoft and what have you, but I am not a fan of their heavy reliance on DLC. Yes, they add a lot of content (mostly a whole bunch of events, with one added mechanic) but added up it does cost quite a bit. My OCD forces me to get the complete package, which is why I usually wait until I can get a gold edition or something. I decided to give Stellaris a go so I could get into it before the DLC packs start flying. And I can't help but feel it is very empty after those first few times you play. So it is with a heavy heart that I await how much I have to invest to get the real experience.
So should I get it or not?
Currently I would say no. I loved the initial hours. It was great. If I had written my review after the first 10 hours it would have been a definite recommendation. But having gone past the early excitement I can't recommend it. It's a teaser. Along the lines of Early Access, I suppose. We get to see what it's like and now we have to wait until the expansions hit the store.
I'm sure it will be great after a few DLC packs. If you're a patient man I would wait for the bundle.			"
281990,icaruswong,21,36,0,True,185.1,June 2,"110 hours in and still on my first game....
Stellaris is my first Paradox game and I've found that it manages to scratch so many itches at once that I wouldn't have imagined possible. To me, it's this perfect blend of Strategy, Simulation. and Roleplaying: a combination of all my favourite genres.
Sure, it's still very rough around the edges, but the core experience of the game amazed me so much I didn't really care. Paradox is still releasing regular content patches to make up for this, so things can only get better. For example, the most recent patch at this time (Clarke) did a huge number of improvements to the AI and warfare.			"
281990,Crimsonstout,21,36,0,True,103.2,May 25,"Well, without putting too fine a point on it, this game has gripped me like no other game this year. It's been a long time since I was as enthusiastic about anything as I am about Stellaris. 
From the moment I started playing, I was hooked. My first empire was a collection of racist, collectivist insects that came to dominate the spiral arm they were born on within 150 years. Then I managed to ♥♥♥♥ off a Fallen Empire, who promptly destroyed all of my ships in a very one-sided war. Everyone else I'd annoyed with my earlier expansion (and constant genocide...) decided to jump in and take me to pieces like hyenas at a carcass. 
I had a few more non-starter games where I was crushed before the century was out, (protip: if you don't feel like having this happen, you can turn 'advanced AI starts down and lower the chances you'll start next to someone big who hates you for existing) but then I decided to roll chill science-y space lizards. 
Now, this is where I have problems with the game in its current form. It was easy from an RP perspective to knock out the empires around me who wanted me dead and burned, but once all of them were gone and I had nothing but nice neighbours, there was pretty much nothing to do. Some of them would have joined an alliance with me, but for some reason that reduces your influence per month, which I needed for lots of things. The rest of them pretty much didn't want anything to do with me. I couldn't travel through their territory with my science ships because we weren't allies, and we couldn't be allies because I needed the influence/they weren't up for it. Which left me having to declare nonsensical wars just to be able to spread out a bit.
There's a lot been said about how the diplomacy side is lacking, and I think that's probably the root of my problems. The other stuff, (strangely scaled UI, combat looking really strange, no map filters) I could either live without or mod in, but not having anything to do in the mid-game is not really something modders can fix. 
I'm pretty confident PDX are going to support Stellaris for a long time, and I doubt they'll leave things the way they are for long, but I guess it's a bit of an oversight to have the middle portion of the game have almost nothing to do in it. Especially considering the endgame crises are excellent (if they fire properly) and early game is serious fun. 
Should you buy this game? That depends. I've put nearly 100 hours in since release, and I don't regret it. As a reader of classic sci-fi, an ex-40k player and a keen fan of Paradox Interactive, I'm probably going to be a little bit biased. This is essentially an early Christmas for me. 
However, the polish just isn't there. If you're on the fence (and you probably are, if you're reading this review) I'd advise you to wait a few months before you dive in, or maybe wait until a sale. If you're not too bothered by the things I've mentioned above and are as massive a science fiction fan as I am, you should just buy it already.			"
281990,76561198030488103,57,105,0,False,46.3,May 28,"In its current state, Stellaris is a not what I would consider game that is up to the standards Paradox has set with their games.
Why?
- Bugs. So many, many, game-breaking, fun-destroying bugs but at least with a promise for fixes. See below.
- Lack of content. We know Paradox sells games with a lower entry price and lots and lots of DLC expansions. That’s the way they roll, and mostly, it works. At least, it works for their own niche of grand strategy. For a game that supposedly crosses over into 4X territory, people have come to expect certain things, like a proper diplomacy system, or some kind of espionage. Current midgame is incredibly dull.
- Clamping brakes on the player. Let me explain. The sector system is, according to the devs, a brilliant way to reduce all the tedious micromanagement. Only that for those people who like micromanagement, the sectors are just as mandatory as for anybody else. Which means that you can keep 5 (10 if you play specifically for core planets) planets under your control. You are then forced to hand the rest over to a broken, dumb-as-bricks AI, which not only makes your empire weaker, it also leads to said empty midgame, because all the nice colony management and tweaking you could spend your time with is stripped away from you. Personally, I don’t buy the micromanagement explanation, I think it’s to slow down human players in comparison to the AI empires, which use the same, broken, dumb-as-bricks sector AI and are generally not the sharpest knives in the drawer.
- Horrible UI. This is perhaps the worst of all, because all others are fixable, and are supposed to be fixed in time, with 2 big patches announced for May and June. But the UI is all form and no function. Pause settings? Nope. Message filter? Nope. Ledger? Useful diplo interface? Nope and nope. Proper event log? What do you think you are playing, a grand strategy game by Paradox? … Oh. Right.
About the bugs:
Want some examples? Sure:
- the ethics systems, central to the game, with factions and what-have-you tied into it, is randomly broken. Divergence is all over the place, sometime your whole population looses an ethic tenet completely before you have even finished surveying your home system (read: in 15 minutes of playtime tops)
- quest chains that might give you something to do in the otherwise dull midgame break at random, because you got survey data or star charts about a system you were supposed to look at, or just because… well, because.
- the battle system is broken. Period. The smallest ships rule supreme, because nothing else hits them.
- did I mention the sector AI being broken? Not only stupid, but simply broken, ignoring the few settings you can give it?
Now, the bugs are supposed to be fixed by the end of June, when the second big patch hits.
The first is currently in beta, but I have not included it in this review because it is currently a mess of back and forth hotfixing (seriously, hotfix deployment on a Friday? That is asking for trouble).
Stellaris is not bad. But it is nowhere as good as it could be.
If you think about buying, wait until the end of June for patch Asimov (1.2) to land, and do more research then. Buying now will only make you mad if your standards are anywhere near mine.
 "
281990,76561198008466188,10,15,0,True,61.9,May 23,"I think this game is a nice mashup of turn-based (Gal Civ) and real-time (Sins) 4x space strategy. It holds up well as a representative of that genre in terms graphics and interface, but I'm guessing you're more interested in what sets it apart from the rest of the pack--for better or worse. 
For Better:
1. The randomized tech tree system is an interesting twist on the usual tech tree. You don't know when you'll see a particular option again, so you really have to weigh each decision. There are occasional ""rare"" cards that show up, too, which are often related to anomolies you've discovered and researched with your science ships. I think all of this is well done.
2. You can assign leaders to command fleets, govern planets or sectors, man science ships or research teams, and lead armies. All of these leaders have their own traits and level up with experience. It literally puts a face on aspects that other games leave rather abstract or generic. 
3. The ship designer lets you customize your ships if you feel like it. It's not as flexible as the designers in similar games, but it's better than nothing. However, I found it more convenient to just let the AI automatically upgrade my ships as new techs became available. In other words, it turned out not to be very useful (to me), but I still appreciate having the option.
4. The music is particularly good. Even after 60 hours of play, I never felt the desire to turn it off or listen to something else instead. Remarkable, really.
For Worse:
1. The developer obviously isn't a fan of micromanaging. Fine, but instead of allowing you to assign sectors or planets to AI, you're forced to. It's my game; I should be allowed to play it how I want, not how a designer thinks I should.
2. Upgrading your fleets take so long that you're better off just destroying or disbanding them and making new ones instead. This isn't realistic and feels wrong.
3. It's irritating during an intense battle to have to keep pausing the game to give new orders to a science vessel, construction ship, research team, or hire a new leader after one passes away. It'd be nice if you could somehow supress time so that you could focus on a battle rather than be constantly distracted with this stuff. It'd be nice if you could set your science and construction ships to automatically survey and build stations, respectively. While the system will let you queue up actions, this doesn't work if you don't currently have the resource (minerals, mostly) available. I'd rather it let me queue up anyway, and just perform the action if and when the resource becomes available.
In balance, though, I think the pros outweigh the cons, particularly if you're burned out on the classics of this genre. Half the fun (to me, at least) of these games is learning the ropes, and this one is sufficiently different to stay engaging for quite awhile.

281990,76561198120181297,47,86,0,False,13.8,May 18,"I come into this review with an extensive and colorful background in strategy games. Stellaris is most readily compared to Master of Orion 2, Endless Space, and vanilla Civilization 5, so that's what I'll be using as a benchmark here.
My main complaint is that this game seems very unfinished. It plays like a beta. There are only hotkeys for about half of the stuff you want to do, the UI is confusing, arcane and the general empire management isn't really that fun.
So let's say you have a gigantic empire of 40-100 planets. If you're good at macroing, well, screw you, since there's a mechanic that punishes you for it. You're not allowed to control more than 5 planets at a time(heavy penalties if you try), and you have to put them into inefficient, AI-controlled ""sectors"" past then, where they can be automatically governed. But the sectors seem to not only make poor decisions, they produce less resources than just owning the cities themselves. It's not very clearly outlined exactly how this works since there isn't an ingame 'civilopedia' or similar, but my biggest complaint is that they don't produce armies or ships during wartime. You have to manually go through your AI-controlled cities, each and every one, and produce ships for your war effort.
Thus, my next point; the hotkeys are garbage. There isn't a hotkey to scroll through your controlled planets (that I know of,) there isn't a hotkey to mass-produce corvettes or battleships from their starports (that I know of.) Shamefully, there are some hotkeys, such as changing between the planetary and galaxy view, but the developers seem to have been extremely short-sighted with what does and doesn't have a hotkey.
This game is played in real-time, so hotkeys should be numerous and useful. But the game isn't truly real-time, because most of your empire management happens while paused. It feels like a Total War game, where all the macromanagement happens turn-based, and all the combat happens in real-time. There's honestly no reason for there to BE a real-timer on the overworld, and this brings up the settings menu. It is completely barren. There's no settings to turn off random events, or turn off negative ones, or turn them down. There's no setting to change the game between real-time and turn-based. There's no setting to speed up the incredibly slow development in the early game (in civ 5, you can start in the classical or medieval or information eras.) Ingame, there's hardly anything to speed up the incredibly slow development of research. You can build a science facility, giving one research per turn in each of the research paths. But researches start to cost 15,000+ research to complete, and no matter the size of your empire, that will still take 40-80 months ingame time. Unheard of in the 4x strategy genre, there is ABSOLUTELY NO research acceleration. No libraries, no research labs, no gas giants you can colonize to generate huge amounts of research/production/whatever.
It plays like a skeleton for future expansions, but I am not optimistic for those expansions. The game, as I find it, is a straight downgrade from Master of Orion 2.			"

There's a LOT I love about this game. I want to give it a thumbs up. But too many serious issues means it gets a thumbs down. If they fix the major stuff, I'm willing to change.
Some major issues:
Very serious slowdowns mid to late game. 
Early game it may take you 1 hour real world to play 10 years of game time (I'm just making up times). Mid and late game  it may take you 5-10 hours to get through that same 10 years....or longer. It's pretty severe. To add insult to injury, this game does not have multi core support. In this day...why? I highly doubt this issue can be fixed due to it coming down to raw number calculations. Without muli-core support, there's really no place to go. Trying to optimize your code will only go so far. This engine came out in 2007 (I think?) so it's highly doubtful they can do much to improve performance.
Diplomacy completely broken.
Get used to games where no one will ever talk to you and everything you try to propose to other opponents will read -1000. In the end it will pretty much always be you, by yourself, against large federations.
Combat system.
MANY, many issues. Just one example....you can have a combat score at 100% and the game will not give you the win due to some other empire taking a planet during your conflict. This is just one example of MANY.
Sector system.
Yeah don't get me started here. I understand what they were going for here, and it failed. Fixing the AI to manage better will go a long way to making it tolerable.
There's many other issues but these are some of the highlights.			"
281990,76561197963743149,13,21,0,False,74.8,May 13,"Long time Paradox fan. Review of the initial release.
Stellaris is an attempt at fusing the Galactic Civilizations / Masters of Orion games with Europa Universalis. As such, it is fairly successful as a proof of concept. The game has a wide amount of content and great writing. Sadly, under the veneer it is extremely shallow. Basically the game needed another year of development to flesh out. Knowing Paradox, that will actually occur over time and players will be forced to pay for that continued development if they want to play a finished product. This explains and justifies the lower initial price of the game.
I cannot recommend the game in the state that it is in, but I suspect this will change in perhaps 6 months time.
Specific gripes
- Diplomacy system is excessively shallow. Think 1\3 of the depth of Civ5.
- Domestic AI (sectors) are an attempt at reducing micro for large empires and simulating the challenges of a sprawling star empire. They end up being both annoying (unable to micro stuff that needs to be microed even when you want to) and downright infuriating (the ai makes suboptimal choices that limit growth).
- Allied AIs simply blob up and follow your main fleet instead of doing any thinking at all.
- Ship designs organization is rudimentary. Probably the most glaring issue. You cannot upgrade ships to different classes; you can only upgrade existing classes. This leads to hair pulling for players used to microing their builds ala Galactic Civilizations.
- Game UI needs a lot of work.			"

No Statistics, No real Demographics, why?
If they took a little more time, wrote a little more events, story, lore, techs, etc. this could be awesome.

281990,fuldry,14,23,0,False,85.8,May 27,"This a 4X game, pausable real-time.
As all 4x game, it's a management game, this one is light on the micro management.
Honestly, the start of the game is really fun, the mid game is boring as hell, the endgame crisis quite limited and depends a lot on luck. And once you enter mid-game on a big map, it's becomes awfully tedious to progress.
I still recommend Endless Space, it's so far, on the 4x games that are light on the micro management, it's IMO still the best in the space opera genre.
Honestly, there are too many things missing, the tech tree is missing a lot of the classical techs that any space op game should give us. You can't invest in getting faster terraforming (one step takes 10 years period), you will not be able to terraform barren or tox planets. You can't destroy planets not suns, you can't build ring worlds, dyson spheres. You can't have a deathstar.
The diplomatic options are so small that is becomes totally uninteresting too.
The game has a LOT of potential the basics are there, but as always with Paradox the game will become great only after 2+ years and 200Ã¢â€šÂ¬ of DLCs...
As I already said, Endless Space.			"
281990,darktidess,28,50,2,False,13.4,May 12,"Game feels empty right now. its sad because the game is superb when you first start it but after 5 hours or so, the AI doesnt do anything and you realise the game is disappointing as little thought was put into late game.
Sectors also need a huge revamp. For the people that don't own the game, sectors are planets and zones that you give to the AI to manage for you.
Sectors need to build ther own military and need to beable to defend themselves as they take up the stardocks,planets and the resources they generate. Right now, sectors become such a heavy burden when you are big and go to war which defeats the whole of making sectors in the first place.
The research/tech tree also has no personality. there are no 'unique' techs like wonders in civilization. The game itself has no 'Tree' and instead it gives you 3-4 random research and on your first few play through, you will end up waddling around several 'branches' because there are prerequisites that you have to go through. For example, if you want to unlock devastator missiles, you need to finish all the tiers of nuclear weapons but the game doesnt tell you that.
Events like civil wars and rebellions also hardly happen unless you mess up big time which is disappointing. Plot blockers such as volcanos or monsters are just for illustration purposes, they do not do anything besides hinder you which doesnt give you a sense of urgency to research and unblock them and instead it is better to just concentrate on expanding all through early game since pirates dont spawn either.
One thing that makes this game stand out from the rest is it's quest system which is written really well but these seem to disappear when you reach the mid game. Wars are also objective based and you do not war against a 'race' or 'faction' like in other 4X games, which means that if you are in an alliance and the AI declares war on your ally, you cannot stop the war and is forced to participate.
The combat AI is also rediculously stupid. the AI targts weak and defenseless ships first so if you are going to fight against someone with a larger stack, you just need to embark all your armies 1 by 1 which will become 24hp transport ships and the fleet will attack these ships slowly before deciding to hit your main fleet which would have obliterated the enemy's fleet. (if you have more money, you can design cheap,fast and evasive corvettes which will do more damage instead of transport ships)
The AI also abuses this which makes it fustrating as you have no control over what happens in combat. (6 battleships that give you around 7-8k MP would lose to a 50 or so corvettes which would be around 4-5k MP, or 8 battleships with 22 destroyers- around 27-28k MPwould lose to 30 transport ships and 50 corvettes/1 battleship- around 11-12k MP)
MP = military power which is used to decide the strength of your units/fleet			"
281990,kitemasaki,17,29,0,False,122.6,May 12,"**UPDATE***
So I decided to give the game 100 hours, since I love Paradox, and this game is still trash. I have a killer rig, yet the game gets really sluggish even on medium maps towards late game.  It isn't optimized at all.  I thought battle mechanics might need just more time on my end...nope...still trash.  Forget about trying to do a war if the enemies all get ""Psi Jump"" since you will never even have a chance to engage in a fight...even if you outnumber them 100 to 1.  This game is just horrible...even Endless Space seems like a AAA title compared to this failure from Paradox.  
---------
Unfortunately I cannot say Stellaris is a good game to try...yet.  It has potential, but overall the game is severely (as in, beta type development) lacking in battle mechanics.  There is no strategy involved nor can you plan for eventual fighting.  There is no espionage, so there is no way of knowing how advanced your foes are, until it is beyond too late.  If you lose a war when you are not warleader, you lose completely with no chance of coming back.   You will see players on forums talking about interchanging weapon modules and tailoring ships to fight you foes...which sounds good (on a forum only) but never works out that way since, as mentioned, you cannot determine what your foes or even allies have going on.
Don't even get started on allies.  Trying to track down their fleet movements is not only a chore, its a game of ""Where's Waldo"".  
Paradox has enough experience to know what is an issue with battle mechanics (since that is one of the biggest gripes in every game), but there is absolutely no excuse for the junk they have presented this time.  Of course, we know that they plan to sell features later in DLCs, witholding features that actually would help.  
This is a complete failure and dissapointment from my favorite dev studio.			"

281990,Fluffyenderman,4,4,0,True,68.7,May 21," Stellaris review 
Stellaris is a great grand-strategy game with already good gameplay and even better potential for the future. If you like strategy games with a big scaled gameplay, Stellaris is definitely a game for you. You are able to spend hours within the game, building up your empire, constructing buildings on planets and fighting wars on a galactic scale. But the game also has its disadvantages. Some main critic points are:
- hard to learn
- game engine is not that well-engineered, it starts to produce lag later in the game
- the AI (enemy, ally and your own sector managing) sometimes does bad decision or is not able to fullfill its role
- diplomacy is not that good in combination with the AI
- mainly designed for singeplayer
But even with its disadvantages I can still recommend Stellaris and when it hopefully gets patched, it will be even better.
7.5/10			"
281990,mcguireman,4,4,0,True,16.4,May 9,"Loving it so far. The gameplay feels like a combination between Civilization 5 and Europa Universalis 4 mechanics, and then put into a space setting. To me, this doesn't really feel like a war game at all. I haven't been in a single war yet (contrary to usually how games like Civ5 and EU4 play out) and mostly been developing my interstellar empire. Also, the music's really good as well.
The two biggest negatives for me currently are that there's only two victories and there's sometimes a weird stuttering thing that goes on, despite my system fitting the requirements.

281990,76561198052295625,4,4,0,True,37.3,May 9,"Plus side:
This is the space game you’ve been waiting for for a decade. Rich, complex, surprising (solving the gretest 4X issue of all playthroughs being more or less identical), each playthrough is different. I expect the ""hours on record"" figure to gain a couple orders of magnitude in the coming months. 
After the bland reskins of the Master of Orion concept (GalCiv, Endless, Distant Worlds), this is finally a truly better game moving the genre forward and setting the new standard with a lot of novel mechanics and depth.
Minus side:
-Combat is simplistic and there is no skill involved. Nobody yet did better than Master of Orion 1 twenty years ago.
-Diplomacy is currently completely broken. Like, you offer a civilization a promise you will not attack them, asking nothing in return (in a bid to boost relations), and they will write back that they refuse your ridiculous request.
-Tutorials are broken. After meeting twenty civilizations, having embassies with three of them and trading with them routinely, you will get a ""First contact! This changes everything!"" message when meeting the twenty first. Broken condition chains happened so often I started completely ignoring the tutorial messages and mini-missions. I expect this to be patched out shortly.
-I am not so sure there is sufficient depth to the various races to make them anything else than reskins with two or three personality variables. Yet to see anything that isn’t ""antropomorphic animal with a randomly generated flavoring"". To draw the inevitable comparison to MOO again, MOO’s few races suffer from the same furry-convention design uninspiredness, but are strongly defined personality archetypes - in Stellaris, all the dozens of avian/reptilian/fungoid empires blend together, and you don’t get the sense of ""hey, these guys are like this, and those guys are that"". The claim of many tens of races is therefore kind of devalued by their relative identity. Also making interesting extra races an optional purchase was kind of a ♥♥♥♥ move to begin with - it’s an essential feature if you want the game to be more replayable. If you’re gonna have thirty plus empires on the map, make sure they feel different.
-Research doesn’t feel as profound/consequential/meaningful as in other 4X games. For whatever reason, I don’t get the sense of excitement and discovery that comes with climbing the tech tree in MOO or Civilization, much less Kerbal Space Program. The game doesn’t communicate the longer-term implication of various venues of research very well.
Verdict: kiss your relatives goodbye and buy the game. You’ll get lost for days and weeks. Paradox pulled off something great, and I hope there will be expansions and DLCs.			"
281990,76561198032195639,4,4,0,True,15.2,May 10,"Hello Gentleman and Ladies just want to tell you of this game called Stellaris.   In my opinion this is easiest to learn and less obtuse of all Paradox games I have ever played.  I am referring to Europa Universalis and Crusader kings, which I still don't understand the whole mechanics of both them.  With Stellaris I jumped right in and with the Help of the in-game tutorial I was off to a running start exploring my Galaxy. 
The interface is really slick, polished and easy to learn compared to the previous games I mentioned from Paradox.  Events where not all coming at once and you can soak each one in and make decisions pretty easily without getting logged jam.  
I might have not logged a ton of hours yet on the game but what I have accomplished in the game like design multiple different races and ships already for first hour of game speaks alot of the depth this games has.  I also started 3 single player games and even chatted on the multiplayer server which had people ready to jump into some multi player fun.
Everything about this game yells quality.   The soundtrack, user interface and attention to details of the planets is astounding while zooming into them.  I don't play alot of 4x games because it gets kinda gets that same ole feeling after awhile, but this game is random and so deep in strategy I can't begin to tell you where to start on what they put in this game.  One example is how you choose your ruler.  I choose Democracy and they have election every 5 years.  I noticed one of the 3 nomiees was favored by the people, even without me endorsing the delegate {which you can at the cost of some influence points}.  I noticed he had a special ability called the peoples champion, just like the ROCK {you know Dwayne Johnson},  which I thought was nice touch.  Of course he won even without my endorsement.  
As I saying this game is deep for my brief play thoughs so far.  You can go as deep in the Rabbit hole as you feel comfortable.  Heck you can stay on the main universe map and let the computer micro everything for you, but you would only be scratching the surface on what this game has to offer.  To be honest it wasn't that hard to learn either and I am kinda surprised for Paradox game.  
Well this game is going to only get better as people start modding it and future DLC from Paradox {especially the diplomatic portion is there, but lacking alot of option we expect from a Paradox game}.  I am looking forward to the day someone Mods the Star Trek Universe!   
Buy this game if you are s Science fiction fan or into any Grand Strategy games {even Civilization games}.  This game has it all.  Let your imaginiation go crazy.

-Buggy (This is their most stable launch, at least on my computer which is low end)
-Diplomacy is not very fun or useful
-Ai is a bit to passive at least in my experience
Neutral
-DLC (Like other Paradox games this will probably be a DLC hog, not that I have a problem with it, its just that their DLC as of late has not been very good and adds alot of features that can break their games or unnessesary fluff)
-More of a Grandstrategy than a 4x
-Only 2 victory conditions (though most Paradox Veterans will probably not care due to this being more GS than 4x, it would be nice for more diplomatic victories since the 2 invlove conquest and war)

Most 4x games I run into I tend to roflstomp the computers unless it's on some of the harder difficulties, and while it took me a moment to accustom myself to how this one works (which I also liked), it had challenge to it from the start and kept the game interesting.

Love it. Hands down, love it. The sounds, music, artwork. Everything looks and feels right. Not overly complicated but some matches can be quite epic, lasting days. What seems to be a massive amount of interactions, choices, and dialogue; all boil down to the same type of inputs. (I'm getting at it's really not that complicated of a game to play). Think of this game as kind of a Sins of a Solar Empire meets Civilization, though, actually less complex IMO (once again). Plays like an RTS yet still feels turn based.
Price seems about right IMO but with this being Paradox, be ready for some DLC to ask for more money. Making a decently priced game a lot more for what might be so little added. Time and reviews on that topic will tell. (Snowfall for Cities Skylines comes to mind).
Things that could make this game even better IMO.
-Bug fixes and they are underway. Stuttering issue is fixed. (Thank god).
-Even more race appearance. There are just under 100 right now but I want more gosh darn it. The art and little animations add to the great feel of the game. Sure, there will be mods but I want original.

However through thoughful expansion and calculated warfare, you become superior to them.  However, that's only in your tiny portion of the galaxy.  Once you zoom out enough, you find factions who have conquered their own region  rivaling yours.  And there's even tougher challenges after that.			"

281990,76561198025669474,18,31,0,False,34.9,May 17,"While the early game is very enjoyable, as soon as you have colonized a couple of planets, the game gets tedious fast. Single player games suffer from a terribly inactive AI and closed borders, which means there is very often not much to do. To make things worse, lots of the fun associated with micromanaging planet development is gone as you are forced to hand over control to a sloppy AI in the form of sector governors. 
Either way, it is very clear that the game in the current state is unfinished and will require many more patches and tweaks to become enjoyable. Having played multiple Paradox titles for many hours, I'm afraid that most of the fixes will come as costly DLC's. ( I am aware that Paradox tends to add a free patch to each DLC release, however, the new gameplay features are almost always exclusive for the DLC, which will definitely be needed here)
Not worth the hefty price tag.			"
281990,ilikekitsunes,18,31,0,True,62.3,May 28,"Got this game because friend has told me its ck2 in space, never played ck2 but heard many fantastic stories and opinions about that game.
Well and its definitely not ck2 in space. Its just a base framework for future addons/dlc's. A bit shallow game.
Early game is really nice  with exploration and early colonization and management, mid game where alliances/federation happens and colony micromanaging and later game which is boring as heck. This game severly lacks proper mid/late game content and ""crisis"" is not proper end-game content. Kinda expected too see my neighbour to ally with me to fight againt extraterrestrial alien swarm but nop. He was still angry at me. It would be nice if we could cease fire for the sake of saving the galaxy. While other empire are collapsing to them.
Every AI behaved the same and any pacicift AI was hating me too becasue I was warmongering with my neighbour too much. Diplomacy is unpolished and shallow. Beyond agreements there is nothing else to do, why I can't marry some pretty alien girl or set a no-man-land by comprosis if war takes too long.
Combat system  *visuals* are terrible and in the late game you just stack those fleets and let the disco lights happen. There is no real tactical depth into it.
Also AI allies/vassals tend to follow your main fleet everywhere. AI is not really fleshed out and it was the easiest/cheapest way to make them usefull in the war. 
Instead of taking a time and planning your tactics with various generals from alliances on the galaxy-map,setting up objectives and everyone would know what to do, you have this. Think how fantastic it would be. But nah not even Military Junta government have anything similar to this, yeah goverments are just bunch of raw stat boosts and AI behaviour alterations.
All alien races feel way too *humanoid* to mee, this game could use more varied gameplay styles like devouring worlds instead of colonizing planets. Also where are robot races? Cyborg races? Its all the same gameplay, only some AIs will colonize more , some less planets.
I won't mention how the game punishes you for having a big population and influence really limits your gameplay. Or several annoyanced like sectors or not-so-good AI. This game also runs on 1 cpu , come one its 2016, you can dream about generating 10k galaxies with 500 AIs in the future with mods. 
Game also has some solid problem in the late game with the performance. And how warscore is not so good idea, what if I just want to glass every planet? What If i don't really care about warscores and I want to quickly conquer their empire? I don't really think every race would behave the same, always respecting *some-kind-of-universal-galaxy-law-about-the-warscore*. Klingonds didn't, they fought for the sake of combat and honours and some should fight for the same of domination, afraidness, using the weak-sides.
Right now it looks like this, you conquer 3 planets, 10year peace-period and repeat. Its called a artifical time extender, same goes for surveying systems with your science ship and clicking on every debris manually by shift-click. I can understand in the early-mid but in the late there could be some kind of automatization, there are bigger concerns than clicking on small X all around the galaxy. Less micromanaging in late-game please.
 no trade routes ( it would be nice to see small cargo-ships travelling between your systems, it would add a lot the the gameplay mechanics like ""cut the supply lines"" )
 ^ also no pirates? really? they only happen in 1 event and disappear forever
 no espionage
 no sabotages
 no family tree? really?
 no marriages
 no sabotages
Good game , had fun but it just feels unfinished. I really dig the random-event and reading lore but there needs to be more of it, especially in the mid/late game.  Its just average game at this moment.  Kinda gets boring after a while.
Maybe after year or two with some decent dlc/updates, this game will get better, well for sure it will get.			"

Those are the complaints. However the atmosphere, nice learning curve, plentiful of events, race designer and possibilites are more than good. If you ever wanted to have true sequel to Master Of Orion 2, this is it (although in real-time). Even though mid-game is little bit sluggish (again, nothing that Paradox wouldn't fix either in patches or expected DLCs), the game is fun as hell and you'll definitely lose your sense in time in real life.
So yeah, there are some issues but nothing that would ruin your experience or was inherent to the game itself. For now on, I would give 8,5/10. After some polish it would be easily 10/10. So jump on the train with us right now and have some fun.			"

I suggest, at least for your first few attempts at playing, to run it with the tutorial-level advice turned on. That won't tell you everything, so it's good to bookmark the wiki page, and to ask questions in the Steam forums (people there have been very helpful, even though I felt like I was acting like a total newb).
In short, this game is a 4X on steroids.  Things starts very slow and you'll have lots of choices to make, especially if you choose to design your own race. There's a lot of levels to the game, but you really don't have to understand everything at the start.  I suggest starting out like I did, following the 'missions' in the tutorial.
Eventually, your empire will get bigger, and then you'll be forced to split everything up into sectors.  Sectors are the games way of dealing with micromanagement.
Also, you'll need to choose leaders based on their cost and traits.  You'll need to pick 3 main research leaders/scientists in each of the 3 main tech trees.  You'll need to pick at least one military guy to run your battle fleet or fleets, and you'll need to assign scientists to science vessels. If you have an army, you'll have to assign a general for that as well.
You'll find any number of different anomalies while your science vessels search the stars around your home planet, and you'll be given decisions to make, the simplest one being, do you commit that ship to analyzing a dangerous anomaly (because there's often a chance of your leader dying). You may have a chance to analyze some some ruins or recover information from a recent combat, or dig up an ancient spacecraft, or initiate a much longer 'mission' to collect biological samples across the galaxy.
Also, depending on your form of government, you may have to deal with elections, and that opens up whole other side of the game: Politics.  With the race I'm playing now, I only have to replace my Empire's leader when the previous one dies, and because I'm in a kind of 'scientocracy' (that's not the name, just that I can't recall what its called), he's selected from my current scientists, and each one has an agenda. You can push for a specific candidate by spending influence, or you can just not do anything, and let things happen as they will.  Each leader has a specific agenda, and will give you different advantages for the duration of his term.
Anyway, that's the game in a nutshell.  In my current game, there are 1000 systems (I hesitate to call them star systems, because a few have black holes or quasars or pulsars at their center), and each system can have any number of planets and asteroids.
If I were forced to compare it to other science fiction 4X games, I'd say that ""Sword of the Stars"" comes the closest, especially with the different choices of travel mechanisms, and random events, and so on. I'd say if you like SotS, yoiu'll probably like Stellaris as well.			"

While Stellaris feels in no way complete or perfect I feel like the aspects of the game it currently has work really well and are enjoyable. 
Late game can get a bit boring however the early game is a lot of fun, it's really hard to stop playing at times.

281990,g4borg,5,6,0,True,88.5,May 30,"I find it really perplexing, that the biggest critique from usually minmax-gaming types is the linear battle system. Which kinda was totally designed for minmaxing, and the most hardcore mmax stars already found out, going for corvettes is the cookie cutting thing, coz, evasive corvettes ftw...
Stuff I love
* The research system - the minigame with the cards, and the rules how to pick research, sometimes changes the pace of how you get your ideal techs for your strategy, and sometimes, reward you for trying to think outside the box. I think, the research system is awesome, as it doesnt allow a single player to get the research upside midgame and keep ahead unchallenged. Minmaxers will cry about it, but it is put in place for them to cry.
* The style. Pseudorealistic sun systems, eve like overview map, funny stories, this game is so much at the core of what makes space games great, its astonishing. I love it, because a lot of details are very well researched, and some events hint that a lot of thought and research is behind the game. It is good, if sci-fi games are made by people actually interested in space science.
* Straight out of the box presets. I dislike some games, which put in 6 races of the campaign, and then allow you modify them, but keep the 6 presets. It's lazy in this century, to do so. If you can do something better, than an indie developer as gamestudio, its assets, so not bringing them, is lazy! But in this game, you got presets en masse. Doesnt go as far as Galactic Civ tho, when it comes to ships...
* Network code and Engine. Runs smooth, is cross platform, runs for hours, never had any game breaking issue. This alone is a huge plus from me, as this is for me the single most important thing to solve - but probably, its also because I work in this area.
The Bad
* Due to the excellent network code, after hours of play, where civ would crash and tell you its late, stellaris still runs. Its not really a con ;)
* I whish there were also more presets for fleet styles. In fact, I whish they would unite with gal civ and make a game out of the two. Or take in endless space aswell.
* Techs are a bit slow, the tech tree a bit small. It could need more side-trees.
* Corvette evasion FTW
* Stations are too expensive to run, I whish there was more chance to build intrastellar infrastructure
* I miss tradestations. I miss cloak. I miss more finetuned local diplomacy. Finishing a small research quest by brokering a deal for one science ship to enter some space - or similar - diplomacy could be more.
* I miss the persistent after thought: the engine itself would be ideal to work on the first mmo-like 4x strategy game, with more persistant homeworlds fighting for distant galaxies. This game is the one which almost cries for a DS setup.
* Game lobby is awesome, but it needs improvement, so that you can truly find games, which are still waiting in lobby, and waiting for players. I find, people are not making big enough games for this game most of the time.
* I think game pace settings for more skirmish like straight to fight games, and more in depth ""use all techs"" games, would be possible, if some of the core techs for linear gameplay could be made cheaper in a separate gamemode, inclusive faster production.
* Fleet upgrade times a bit too much.
* Perk system could need more traits.
Verdict
Totally recommended for any fans of 4X games. It is the perfect real time game that feels like a turn based game, but isnt, and is very close to the gameplay we all dreamt about - even if it could be more perfect.
If you like Civ-like games, Endless games, or Paradox games, Stellaris is a must for you.
Gal Civ and Endless space might have some depth and creativity in some regards, stellaris could still need tho.
It still feels still a bit like unfinished business, much like a no-dlc civ would - but thats okay, given that what is finished in the game truly feels well thought out, and just works for now!			"

I'm stuck in the Stellaris Void.			"
281990,76561198061945264,5,6,0,True,75.6,June 17,"This game is great but is also very flawed. The build up and empire management is enjoyable, my favorite part is serving people in my empire's needs, expanding my galactice empire with colonization, dealing with galactic doomsday events, and also waring for more territory with other empires. Its biggest flaws are in diplomacy, combat, and victory types. 
Diplomacy is basic and boring, if you've played Civ 5 its about as complex as that except even more limited. You can't see what people can afford from you so you never know why a person is declining a deal unless of course they dislike you. Forming a Federation seems interesting except its basically just an alliance with more restrictions and a shared star fleet. With an alliance you can entice your allies to join a war with planets and stuff. But in a federation you have to be president to declare war and if you aren't then you just sit there twiddling your thumbs. 
Thats another thing: Mid to late game is exceedingly boring unless you're at war. Because of the limited diplomacy system politics with other empires is boring and the only ways to win are by controlling all the habitable planets or being the dominant empire(you may be able to do this if your alliance/federation does these things but I wouldn't know because getting to that point seems useless and a waste of time). Being pacifist doesn't really get you anything other than the chance for other empires to like you more, but that doesn't really matter when other empires will declare war on you about as often as a cat playing the piano. Ending wars can also be annoying because you can't ask for more even if you have a massive advantage, its either the war goals you set at the begining or only some of them depending on how well you do in the war.
Now I've vented about a lot of the problems this game has but here's the good stuff: This game has massive replayablity. Everytime you want to start a new game you can either use the permade empires that come with the game(which are fun parodies of popular sci-fi empires) or create your own species. This species empire gets you ethics, traits(like advantages and disadvantages), ship designs, color schemes, and more. These thing will actually effect the way you play. If you're a pacifist for example and you discover primitives(pre-intersellar travel tech people) you can observe them but your ethic says you cannot interfere with them. Alternatively with other ethics you can just straight up invade and subjugate their people, aggressively observe them(ufo abduction type stuff, this has its own effects on the people) or you can infiltrate their governments and take them over from the inside. This makes for really entertaining gameplay as you do other things.
Empire managment is actually enjoyable. You can either give all your planets a good balance of all resources or you can min/max more than a WoW veteran. And in order to make your galactic empire more manageable you can either create districts, which are semi-autonomous regions in your empire, or vassals. These are fully autonomous smaller empires that you can either create by conquering another empire or make using your own territory. They don't give you any resources from what I can tell though so its hard to say how useful one is vs. a district. Factions of dissatisfided citizens can also spring up and if left unchecked they can revolt and try to form their own territory and empire. In my current game I have a lot of factions from constant conquering of other people so my planets are filled with xenomorphs to put down revolts. And yes, I said xenomorphs. You can create different types of armies with different advantages which you'll need when you invade enemy planets.
Fleet combat is simple enough to immidately understand but can be complex enough if you really want to do well. Generally, bigger numbers=win but obviously at a cost with both fleets sloging each other. A smarter stragetist will lure other smaller fleets and make it impossible for them to escape, this is very effective later game.
Galactic doomsday events are also fun. In mid to late game you or one of the other empires will play with fire and get burnt. It's up to you can the rest of the galaxy to put it out before it gets out of hand and destroys everyone, its a very Independance Day all-countries-getting-together-to-fight-alien-menace type situation and its very enjoyable. I don't want to spoil what can happen so I won't say what they are.
Overall: Good game, needs more			"
281990,jokerfett,5,6,0,True,36.2,June 24,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a Paradox fanboy.  While I've had my fun dabbling in Cities: Skylines, I've never been quite able to break into Paradox's ""hard strategy"" games like CK2 or EUIV.  The five hours total that I have spent playing Crusader Kings 2 were five hours of essentially bumbling around in the dark trying to figure out how to assassinate a sibling.  With that in mind, Stellaris is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in years.  
What it comes down to is that Stellaris is a game that completely understands its genre and I'm not just talking about strategy.  This game nails Science Fiction through emergent storytelling that unfolds as you expand your empire.  The initial thrill of venturing out of your home solar system for the first time, not sure what you'll find at the other end of an FTL jump.  The uncertainty that comes with making first contact with a sentient alien race.  Tackling the moral dilemas of slavery, war, and artificial intelligence.  And then of course the crescendo of facing one of the endgame crises that can mean the extincition of your civilization.  The best way I can put it is to imagine Star Trek except you're everyone in the Federation.  You're a scientist charting new worlds and civilizations and deciding to respect or violate the prime directive.  You're an admiral facing down an enemy fleet. And you're a diplomat juggling the needs of friends and foes alike.  Now that is an experience that I've truly never had in a videogame before, even other strategy games.  I give Stellaris the highest of recommendations and I imagine I'll be playing it for years to come.			"

Could this be true?
Heading the rambles of the mindless savage; I ordered my best commander to take the Royal Guard of the entire Juvan race, and protecters of the Military Junta that had reigned for over 200 years with an iron fist; to ground zero. The Royal Guard was not only fitted with the best weapons, armor, shields, and energy capacitors my race could produce, but aswell a newly made Flagship, The Purifier (mod). The Purifier was a planet busting weapon of which could take on any army, and at the size of a moon; its size alone could intimidate any being.
As we approached the site a transmission aired.
""PREY, SO MUCH PREY!!""
The transmission ended abruptly with the only image of, what looked like, a gaseous being comprised entirely of... energy?

I first saw Stellaris on Steam some week ago and was quick to add it to my wishlist due to the single fact that I hoped it would be the 4x RTS space game that I have been waiting for. I only bought the game a few days ago because I started watching some game plays on Youtube. 
I have to say, this game is everything I was looking for and more. I wanted a game where I could start a space empire and rule the galaxy, and Stellaris is that and everything more. From an enormous 300+ technology hodgepodge (not a tech tree) that you can study throughout your session, to an in depth ship designing page, to an intense foriegn diplomacy tango.
The other night as I was playing, I was being beaten down by a powerful opponent who had a much larger navy than I. It was only when my allies came together and helped me defeat them was I savved. The whole experience was very ""anime style fights where the bad guy is beaten by the power of friendship.""
The only factor that I really did not like from this game, was the fact that I ended up staying awake 'till 2am two nights in a row. I had to force myself to stop playing. Once you start playing Stellaris you can not stop. I am just glad I did not have work the next day.

What MOO did to create it, MOO2 did to advance it, and MOO3 did to kill it (and, despite a few solid attempts between then and now, such as GalCiv, StarDrive, Distant Worlds, Space Empires and Endless Space, to name just a few), this game actually revives the entire type of game and turns it from a who can grow the fastest and out-build everybody else into an actual strategy game.  
Take it with a grain of salt, though.  The game is new, there are some bugs (some still game breaking) and there is a lot of room for improvement.  But, Paradox being Paradox, that is coming, and coming SOON.  Yes, the first two big patches already have a dev diary up, and should be available shortly.  DLC will happen, and it will cost a few bucks, but that also keeps the devs working on the game.  
I am not going to go into a million details of what is great (or about the current batch of bugs that shipped with release, which is what most of the reviews I am reading are about â€“ as those will soon be fixed), take a look out there, watch a few youtube videos if this game is of interest, and if $$ is an issue, wait for a sale.  I pre-purchased and I will say that I am definitely not disappointed, and I now have a much higher standard that I would expect all future 4x games to live up to.

Like too many games these days. Stellaris is brilliant but far from complete. You can spend hours and hours enjoying this game only to get to a certain point and there's basically a sign up that says ""Sorry, you've run out of game. Come back later when we've finished."" It's a really gross and tricky shell game the devs are playing.
It's like if you were to get to the industrial era in CIV and have nothing but future tech to research. At a certain point the only thing you can research is incremental improvements on your already samey-samey weapons and technology,.
Another sign that they're not done with this game? An upcoming patch removes an entire feature (embassies) for balance purposes. This is the clearest sign that we are paying to beta test this product. On the one hand  they are making good changes but on the other hand they should have had things like this sorted out prior to me paying full price for it.
The good? This game will be GREAT when it's done. I mean that. It's already fun to explore the galaxy and to a lesser extent the tech trees in the early parts of this game. All they need to do is flesh out the mid and late game, and that appears to be the plan. For that reason I'm not entirely infuriated. At least I've contributed to something that will some day pay off. I just hope that comes in the form of more free patches instead of paid DLC.			"
281990,fleshbits,21,37,4,False,51.2,May 13,"Unlike most reviewers. whom gave their reviews a few hours in, I played until the end to see if it had anything to offer except a mundane click fest through a linear path of decisions that a cave man could make.
There is zero strategy to this game. It's just a bunch of trivial comparisons and a huge game of whackamole.
""rrr me need energy...me take""....""rrr he bigger than me...me fight later"".....""me need ships...me click more...""
Every single person playing the game, plays it the exact same way, if they are playing the same ethos. There are no decisions, strategies, or tactics, beyond the basic game mechanics and comparisons. If we took 50 random people to write up a ""strategy guide"" on thier own, they would all look exactly the same.
You will spend the first 8 hours or so clicking your science vessels to go explore to the reaches of thier range, finding asteroid and planets to build stations on, clicking your construction ship to go build them, clicking and staring, clicking and staring, watching your resource counters inch up bit by bit. You could build some colony ships to go inhabit other planets, and then you click and stare some more as you follow the linear progression of buildings on the tiles of each planet, watching your resources inch up some more.
You choose from a random draw of techs for each of your 3 slots. The game draws from a weighted deck and gives you a few options to choose from each time a tech is done researching. This limits your strategy and decision making even more. You simply choose whatever is most advantageous at the moment. No real though involved. In this manner, they force you to have a ""different playstyle"" each playthrough, but it really just equates to a random roll deciding whether you'll build your economy or war machine first.
After the initial entire day or night of set-up, you get to click and stare some more, as you slowly build your fleet of ships. Perhaps you spotted another AI to go and kill. So you click and stare until your fleet cap is met. Maybe you have to make the really hard decision of assigning a governor to your planets or a admiral to your ship, to get some %5 bonuses. Oh which to choose?!
Then you go pummel your neighbor. Depending on the ethos of your race, you either assimilate them, enslave them, or purge them. If you choose the wrong one, they rebel and you lose all the ♥♥♥♥ you just spent hours taking. Don't worry though, its pretty obvious which you choose. If you can fire 2 brain cells, you got this!
Now you've taken your neighbor. Repeat the setup cycle again. Click and stare, until every asteroid and planet is mined and everything within range is explored.
Now attack someone else. Decision time! Real strategy! Is he bigger than you? If so, attack someone else. You got this!
You can add the complexity of AIs forming alliances and federations, banding together to defeat you. I suppose you can fire up brain cell #4 and try to see this coming based on thier ethos and relation to you. Decide which to attack first and which to leave for later. Maybe you want to ally with someone yourself. You can do it!
The diplomacy is binary. They accept or they don't. Pretty much, you just trade one resource for another at a set rate, for a loss, with anyone who matches your ethos. Everyone else will tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off. You can ally if you like, but then the AI is just going to spam you with useless and worthless wars he wants to get into across the map.
It has a ton of scripted events, that give you resources, bonuses to the potentiual resources, or maybe they just kill your level 5 scientist. If you enjoy reading until your eyes bleed, you may...then a dice will be rolled.
Combat consists of your fleet and the enemy fleet charging at eachother then you watching as they slowly eat up one another's hp and shields. the only interaction you have during combat is whether or not to hit the ""retreat"" button, in which case you jump to a neighboring system and they chase you.
The game has a FTL system consisting of warp, hyper drive, and worm holes. You choose yours at game start. The problem is, all of these are so fast that both you and the AI will be blowing up each other's systems all over the map and leaving before anyone can get to you. It takes about 3 seconds to wipe a system. When you see the enemy coming, hit the button and *poof*. This makes playing the AI a game of wahck-a-mole. It makes multiplayer completely worthless, as you will end up sniping each other until you are both staring at one another from your homeworld. There is no warp blocker of any kind.
That's pretty much it. A very long a mundane game, even on small maps. You just click and stare, step by step, through the linear path to victory. See a red blip, go chase it...he warped...go chase it more. Until you own the galaxy.
For a ""grand strategy in space"", I don't see any strategy here. I could of watched an entire TV series while playing if I didn't have to click so damn much.			"

I don’t want to bore you is just state that I played a lot of Strategy Games.
This Game is promising, the Style is nice and the Graphic isn’t bad, not good but usable.
There are no real innovative, you saw everything in this game before somewhere else so get this right out of the way.
Building your Empire is Straight forward, explore, settle, profit but you cant Control everything.
After 5-6 Planets you have to give up to your (dump) Sector AI and can go to find more Planets to Settle.
While exploring there are some Anomaly’s to find, they Range from Resources to Ships or Upgrades. From now to then there are short quests like “Explore X Planets” or “bring back some pets” to find, but the Variety is so low that you find them Boring after a few starts.
After a while you will encounter other Empires, some of them are Fallen empires which are Mostly useless, ignoring them works well. Diplomacy is mostly standard declare war, find like minded friends, rivals and Vassals.
Combat is like in any other game of this kind Rocket, Laser and Mass driver with Armour and Shield so there is nothing more to say.
At every Corner there is a hint of Gratenes and then their is this dead end.
The AI is pretty weak, one small fleet to distract his whole Force.
UI isnt flashed out, there are images missing and so many useless information.
Combat its just a ball of ships ticking their HP away.
Diplomacy is missing Crucial things like demand open borders or demand tribute, things that are in mostly any game out there.
Events are so few they seem boring after the 3rd or 4th start.

281990,76561198067720359,8,12,0,False,34.3,May 21,"Stellaris is a game that sadly fails to deliver much beyond its initial promise.
The gameplay and mechanics should be familiar to anyone who's played 4X strategy titles. Race design and ship design are extremely fun, even if their practical applications are minimal.
However, the game hits several major hangups:
1) Gameplay is extremely repetitive. The number of ""anomalies"" (read: subplot drivers) is very limited so the game tends to play the same regardless of how you built your empire. There are no real incentives for playing a pacifist or mercantile empire, and the game mechanics don't really inclue a ""trade"" system beyond the existing resources.
2) Diplomacy is pretty much nonfunctional. The system design resembles Total War in many ways, but other empires seem to reject completely reasonable proposals, even outright advantageous ones, while accepting completely ludicrous or exploitative proposals.
3) Multiplayer setup is maddening. Every time I try to get our group of four together to game I plan on at least 30 minutes of trying to work around the innumerable bugs and issues. For a game that prides itself on its multiplayer focus (being able to save multiplayer games and resume them later, etc.), this is unacceptable.
All in all, Stellaris feels like a letdown. I may have to check back on it in a year or two.			"

281990,76561198032979746,8,12,0,True,274.6,May 23,"I have played this game more than any other right from the start because it has been very entertaining and once I started to figure out what was happening it got even better.  I have restarted about 12 times because I wanted to try variations on traits and personalities but I like the universe I am in this time so I might finish in this one although I think it will take some time.  It is fun colonizing planets and negotiating (or killing) your alien neighbors.  I was collecting life forms but I new I needed border access to a neighbor to get the last one.  They weren't willing to let me in but my allies declared war on them and when we won I could send my science ship in to get it :)  
Clearing out monsters and keeping your economy balanced takes a bit of work but it is fun and keeps you thinking.  I almost saved a planet from deadly plants that started out making my colonists happier by ""co-existing"" with them until they mutated and turned the planet into a toxic wasteland.  So sad for the colonists... 
I really like the game so far and will keep playing it for some time.
The steam achievements only seem to work on ironman hmm oh well I don't care so much maybe later...  Check out youtube Stellaris Blorg.  If you like what you see then you will like this game.
Update over 100 hours still playing...  Asteroids are much easier to stop when you have a massive fleet instead of three corvettes busy running around doing other stuff.  Many empires have joined our federation.  Many others are fearful.  Some we have eased the fear by vassalizing >:)   Now they do what I want.  Never have enough energy credits still lots of planets to colonize.  Still having fun.
One thing that would be nice would be if there were some differences to races other than the pictures.  Basically you can make any race do any thing-it might be more fun to pick a race and see how that works for you with a predefined trait (and encounter them in the game).  All races are the same no matter what they look like though.
Still only a minor issue really.  Might add to this later-going to play now!
Update:  Empire now spans almost half the galaxy.  Every so often we find someone to have a border skirmish with (either when I am Federation President to make another vassal  or when one of my other fed members becomes aggressive).  Major problems energy drain from massive infrastructure and fleet size (almost 100k altogether) draining over 214 energy per month after allowing for all my income.  Fortunately there are other empires with extra energy that kinda say they like me (possibly because I vassalized them...).  I think the big problem is this huge fleet though.  Hmm what to do about that?  Suddenly a huge dimensional rift opened up with nasty aliens that want to eat everybody.  I have a plan for all these extra ships now.  Maybe I won't have to pay so much maintenance if the aliens wreck some...			"

If PI move in the right direction with patches, then eventually (12-18 months) it'll be good - perhaps best in class.

-Factions- This is so horrible it has ruined the game for me. They are not fun and are just annoying. They are impossible to keep happy. 
-Planet cap- depending on the government you can only control about 5 planets. You have to create sectors. This also really sucks, I wish there was an option to disable the requirment.

Like most Paradox games there is a ton of possibility waiting to be unlocked by piles of DLC. I don't know if they do this on purpose or just throw a half-baked idea out there and see where the players ask for things to be filled in later. The ability to create a race is neat but doesn't seem to make much difference that I've seen since you can pick any type of race and the traits which create the modifiers are available to any race whether a cat person or a fungus person. 
The AI players are incredibly passive and their war strategy boils down to making a huge fleet and launching it at you. If you can beat that giant fleet you win every time and they will just spend the rest of the war sending ships at you piecemeal as they complete them and you can just go planet to planet picking off the enemy where you want. The AI is also quite happy to surrender after a few setbacks I've yet to see one fight to anything like a proper ending. 
You are allowed to conquer only so many planets after that limit it goes to the AI controlled sectors that the AI can't properly manage you will be reduced to tears as you watch how poorly a job the AI does with your conquered/colonized planets. 
Ship designer is pick parts A,B,C and not nearly as awesome as the designer in Galactic Civilizations.
Diplomacy is worthless and the AI basically greets you when you discover them and then ignores you until war is declared.
Okay enough complaining what doesn't suck?
The random events are pretty neat. 
Your colonists will gradually evolve on their own forming new factions or even literally evolving into distinct races on their own and leading to infighting which will destroy buildings or lead to race wars costing countless lives.
The research tree is clever you pretty much get the same techs each game but they are unlocked in different orders so you can't just rush the same techs every game since some are offered earlier or later (even MUCH later) than others each time. 
You can replace your people with robots that will happily toil on ice covered worlds without complaining like your lazy organic subjects do.
You can move populations from planet to planet or launch a genocide to purge less cooperative factions or races you've conquered that don't appreciate your rule. Bird people not digging your fungus despotism? Kill 'em all. Replace them with robots. 
There is much to like but much that is awful or not quite there if you want a fully fleshed out alternative to Galactic Civilizations (my benchmark for space 4X goodness) this isn't it. In time I think this game will give Galactic Civilizations a run for their money but at this point it is a ""meh"". A good ""meh"" but still a ""meh"".			"

The ability to bring other species into your empire by various means (genetics, politics, enslavement) is cool. It's also fun to have tons of control over ship design and species design.
That being said, the game just kind of putters out after a while. The beginning is really great, then it slows down. It feels like something big will eventually happen, but it never really pays off. There is not thought put into the mid-game, and the end game is just not much of a pay off. There are only two victory conditions, which rely on either killing everybody (which is tedious due to the war system) or colonizing tons of mediocre planets (which is tedious due to the terraforming system).
Some aspects of the game have a ton of depth, but never really get used. For example, there are tons of different weapon types you can get for ships, but I easily plowed through the game with whatever happened to be the default type for my race. There is a huge galaxy with npc enemies to fight, but they become redundant quickly and by mid game pose no threat at all to anything but lone science ships.
This game could really shine, if there were as much depth in the second half of the game as there is in the first. The first several hours are an exciting period of exploration and discovery. The rest of the game is a matter of micro-management in hopes of a payoff that just doesn't come.
With some more thought put to the end game (maybe more victory types like ascension or more neat stuff to explore) this game could be truly great. The platform for something awesome is there, it just feels like you end up with nothing cool to do with it after a while.			"
281990,cheesywotsit,8,12,0,False,108.4,June 12,"Canot recommend this game, the late game is utterly broken. Not only on an actual gameplay value, micro management of vast areas and fleets of space grows dull very quickly the situation log, one of the interesting parts of the early game all but dries up to nothing and diplomacy or at least certain aspects of it leave you in a situation where you either stand by yourself and get the floor wiped with you or stand with a Federation and then have no say in who or what you declare war on because your fellow members spend all their time declaring war on your behalf without ever giving you a say or opinion on the Warscore goals (a feature by the way that does not work both ways, i.e if you declare war they get a chance to veto the vote unless you give them a shot at some Warscore goals.)
You also have the issue with late game battles, you have four classes of ship as a player you think biggest ship equals the best, lets build vast fleets using them, nope the reality is the smallest and weakest ship is the best, in fact the entire game can be played without ever needing to build anything but Corvettes. Don't believe me watch as your 75K Battleship fleet gets torn to pieces by the AIs 20K fleet that comprises of mostly smaller ships (the AI clearly knows which ships are best.)
The other issue is on the games technical level, the game is 32bit and uses a single core which is frankly pathetic in this day and age and while this isn't an issue in early game once you get to late game with huge fleets, and huge amounts of background stuff going on the game becomes an utter chore, everything chugs along, command inputs get ignored of delayed (watch as you click a button to reroute a fleet only for it to ignore you) it is utterly pathetic. (4690K I5 at 3.6Ghz with a 980GTX)

The only way to expand is to war with other nations and cede their planets but the war score only allows you to make limited demands so you would have to constantly have to war with the same nation(the bigger it is the longer it takes) in a cycle of war and peace that makes no sense.
-If you take over a planet and they start to rebel( which will happen) the planet will prduce nothhing but unhappiness. If the faction bar gets to high the planet's pops attack your army, become independant again and Instantly get a navy more powerful than yours. This breaks the game and and was the last straw for me.
-My other problem( and the more larger one) is that when you get to the late game it stagnates. The Galactic ""Situations"" are pretty much ignored by everone. The only way to stay around to take on other nations(most will be in their own federation)is to get in a federation yourself and go to war with them to take ""some"" of their planets. Their really isn't a way to ""Conquer"" the galaxy(Which is required to win)  unless you want to spend 200+ hours on a single game.
-By the way for some reason achievements are only unlocked in ironman mode
I wanted to like this game, I was even looking forward to when it came out. In the end I was sorely dissapointed and determined this game is a huge time sink, Wasted time and wasted money			"

with new features and interesting mid and end game. 
I'd read every dev diary, watched Blorg streams and pre-order the game. Now I regret that.
Early game is really good and fun, but when you reach the mid game and create first sector, it gets boring. AI is dull, very passive, doing nothing. 
Diplomacy choices? Very poor and the communication options are still the same (even they'd promised that this one will be more complex than in other 4X, it isn't).
Trading? There is none.
Maybe modes or dlcs' can'll fix a lot of gameplay issues, lack of features or removes some stupid limitations.

281990,76561198050158621,23,41,0,True,33.6,May 25,"Stellaris is an amazing game. like most other paradox titles its a grand strategy/RTS/sandbox game; with a space setting.
the game allows for a ton of freedom and customization in many areas the only one i find lacking is the government/ethics selections. Not in that they cant be changed or anything but rather certain traits handcuff you to a governemnt. this is just my one little gripe, but you may find it suffciant.
The tutorial eases you in decently. some paradox games will throw you into the fire with bare minimum knowledge, which i am critical of, but stellaris sufficiantly gave it some effort. not great but enough.
like most other paradox games, its going to take awhile to learn the game in and out, theres a massive amount to memorize and keep track of at once.(which leads me into the next part)
When i play a game like civ, after i grow to a extremely large nation i tend to get bored maintaning every fabric of my nation. stellaris takes out this extra maintenance by allowing you to add sectors. basically the system is a very simple version of the one used in CK2. you simply select the area of the sector and if you please, assign a governer, and the system will competently handle work in that sector. super simple, and sooooo helpful.
for those of you who love mods, be at home, paradox will let you do whatever you want. although i only run 1 mod in stellaris and its purely a visual mod (Zbuetiful battles mod). to contrast this game to a game i believe to be sub par. i run that 1 visual mod to run stellaris, while when i play XCOM 2 i usually run about 20+ mods at once. this is just a testment to how good stellaris is, it really doesnt need tweaking. 
Because the game is so flexable customization wise, i can see this game before modding to have tremendous replay value. once you add mods you could probably play this until your PC dies (or you do)
100% recommend this game for the freedom to take your nation wherever it wants in small details or larger ideas.			"

281990,76561198043623791,9,14,0,False,333.5,June 10,"Unfortunately, Stellaris is at once deeply flawed and obviously incomplete. Drawing lines between the two is not so simple a task.
The centerpiece of its mechanical and conceptual failings is its Sector AI system. In the broadest of terms, this is a ""friendly"" AI component that, in any reasonably-successful playthrough, you must use, on pain of crippling penalties to your empire's efficacy. And it is terrible.
The ability of the human player to give it instructions is severely limited, and, even within those limitations, the Sector AI is belligerent and stupid. But let me be clear: those limitations themselves are crippling and unreasonable, and speak to deep conceptual flaws with the game. Sectors are created by linking multiple star systems together, and those star systems must be ""next to"" each other according to the game. Thus, Sectors are a geographical organizational method. The trouble is, virtually nothing else about internal empire management is about geography. One system might contain two planets that the player will want to specialize in very different ways - and, indeed, might be encouraged to specialize in different ways by the presence of planet-specific bonuses or penalties (e.g., lower food output, higher mineral output, more research, less happy population.) But a Sector can only be told to focus on one broad area of development. So, even if your Sector is comprised of a single system, it still could be wholly incapable of coming even remotely close to doing what any middling player would know to do... and all of this is assuming it could even follow limited instructions properly. But it can't. It cannot develop new planets even close to ideally. It cannot construct (or refrain from constructing) spaceports ideally. It cannot manage population units on planets' tile-squares effectively. While I'm sure it does many things right, it does so many immediately-obvious things wrong so often that the well is thoroughly poisoned. No partial credit for building a car that goes really fast but explodes and kills all its passengers.
Other game systems suffer similar deep conceptual issues, but nothing quite so severe as the Sector fiasco. Sadly, the Sector fiasco has tentacles that go everywhere. But still: ship design isn't well-thought-out, even after a balance pass in 1.1. Weapon balance is not up to snuff, which includes the balancing of various defenses. The method by which wars' successes/failures are tallied and weighted is horribly flawed. Diplomacy is, much like the whole game, both flawed and incomplete. Espionage does not exist.
As many other reviews have stated, Stellaris's unique flavor - fueled by ""events"" that trigger occasionally on their own, or are more often discovered via scanning new planets in new systems - is loaded up into the early game, leaving the middle-game and the endgame incredibly barren. When a player gets to mid-game, all at once they are confronted by an omnipresent ""friendly"" AI that is behaving inexcusably badly, and a lack of anything else to do except to pick a war to fight, grab more territory, and slowly crawl their way to a hollow galactic domination that barely feels earned, let alone alive.
I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. On its own terms, it is a failure that feels rushed, incomplete, and poorly-conceived in many areas all the way back to the drawing board phase. If I were to raise the bar and judge it on my terms, it would fare even worse.			"

Not an honest approach at all because:
- the game is obviously incomplete (comparing to other similar products)
- the game is obviously stunning during the first phases, then quickly drops to nothingness in mid-game (I did not even bother to get to late game)

If you want to buy it, wait till Clarke or preferably Asimov updates so as to get the proper experience ,as there are still alot of bugs and imbalances , but once those are ironed out it will be worth a full price purchase ( even in its current state people are putting 50+ hrs in so that should tell you something ).
Pros : - the big one: it is to me the first game that feels like im actually building a space empire
          - lots of customization
          - bunch of mods
          - meaningful race design choices ( ftl , race traits , ethics )
          - interesting research system ( weighted card based , but takes too long to explain )
          - it is an actual strategy game so its your strategy that dictates your success
          - sectors ( alot of people hate them , for me its fine , they are very inefficient , but you can work around it if 
            you want to and it saves me from the micro hell of mid and late game in singleplayer)
          - the stories it creates ( note not storytelling to there are some good easter eggs , but the stories you make by 
            playing it )
          - RNG ( in starting position , events and tech , i like it)
 
Cons: -it feels like a modulless spacestation that still has major kinks ( hopefully Asimov and Clarke will work those out )
          -this means that you can feel where there will be addons to the game as some areas feel pretty barebones 
            ( the major areas for me are diplomacy , war goals , sector control , stuff to do mid and late game , especially 
              victory goals) again they are solid bones , just bare
           - the Ai.... it has ""quirks"" and is the reason i would emphasize waiting for the next two big patches as they will
             focus alot on fixing it ( it doesnt react to late game crisises , follows your fleets around like a pack of 
             baby ducklings and it sometimes gets stuck in wars with it self  ,are the more deal breaking ones that 
            will hopefully be fixed )

At this point it time, Stelaris is only a good buy for people who like to play early access games... which is to say, definitely only the most serious fans.

Stellaris is an amazing game if you like grand strategies and space. Compared to Paradoxes other grand strategies this one is fairly easy to learn and just generally get into, the resource management isn't very hard and could almost be compared to the Civilization series with the ""unique"" resources for specific buildings, just as Civ as resources for units. Simple currency management is another thing Stellaris has, it's simple really just make sure your economy can sustain your navies, mining/research stations and buildings on your planet and everything will be alright just to note there is two different type of currencies, Minerals and Energy Credits there isn't a major difference other than the fact they both are used as upkeep for your navies, credits are used for Buildings, stations and armies, as you can tell it's fairly simple just make sure it's not in the minus and you'll be fine.There is also 3 different type of research points you can use to increase research but that's pretty self explanatory if you get the game.
Now, when (and if) you get the game you won't actually have a tutorial unlike most other Paradox titles which normally have a tutorial of sorts, Stellaris offers you a robot called VIR that will help you by giving you tips and giving you a brief explanation of almost everything. A few examples of this is if you were to click on your navy, VIR will give you a brief idea of what a navy does and how you can expand it and upgrade it. The mechanics of Stellaris is fairly simple, in about 20 hours of a singeplayer game I got the general idea of the basics, at 40 hours I now have a general understanding of most techs and how the game plays such as how to expand and what not.  The game isn't hard to get into but if you've played previous titles by Paradox you will almost feel at home with their simple and easy to navigate UI system. Though the game may seem like you'll get bored there is a lot to do and the empire creator aspect of this game is easily one of the best things currently in it.
The game at the moment is well worth it's price but some people don't think it has much to offer even though it is a pretty huge game. at the moment I'd recommed it for it's current price range. And if you're worried about something you read on a website or another review about lack of content or bugs, paradox is currently working on patches and will almost always work on patches to keep the game bug free and add fresh content that people have requested. (They're currently working on a patch right now that'll add more feautures to the empire creator. 19th/May/2016)
My personel opinion on the game
For  Singeplayer. It's a solid 6/10. The game, as it stands doesn't have the best diplomacy with A.l. It can be quite boring as it's easy to beat the AI unless you're at a major disadvantage. Though to shine some light on Singeplayer, they have more missions that you'll receive as you go on playing the game. Also playing ironman to get achievements is nice if you want to try and get a few. 
For Multiplayer. It's around about 8-9/10. Multiplayer is very fun at the moment, it's probably going to be one of the only times you'll experience a real space battle with tactics and mixed weaponary as the AI just doesn't seem to do that. Diplomacy can work slighty better than how it would with the AI and alliances/federations will become something people might need to survive or just to prevent a intergalactic war from happening. (Also conflict is amazing when you steal someones planet they wanted to colonize.)
Overall if you want a fairly simple and fun Grand Strategy made by one of the best Game Development companies out there, I wholeheartedly recommend you to purchase this, if you don't think it's worth it's price I recommend you  at the least wishlist it and wait for a sale to pop up and then get it.

281990,NaztyFox,16,28,0,True,50.1,May 16,"I put 40 hours into this game within the first week of having it. That's a full work week, but to be fair I was sick...
This is one of the best 4x strategy games I have ever had the pleasure of picking up and playing. Once you get your hands on this game it will be extremely difficult to put it down. I've already dedicated 2 full nights to this game and see many more in the future.
Stellaris can be intimidating when you first start playing. I'm a fan of 4x strategy and even I was a little wary of everything going on in this game. The good thing is that Paradox crafted an amazing tutorial that guides you through everything you need to know. I definitely recommend turning the tutorial to full even if you have 4x experience. Don't expect to crush the AI the first time you play either. While the tutorial is great there is so much depth to the game that it takes a few playthroughs to start figuring out your play style and how best to play it.
You start off by selecting your empire. You can choose from a bunch of preset empires or you can craft your own. I definitely suggest crafting your own, it's entertaining and you can really tailor the empire to your needs. A quick tip from me, wormhole is one of the better travel options in my opinion. Itâ€™s not a hard concept so don't be off-put by the (advanced players) tag attached to it.
Once you're done fine tuning your empire it's time to choose your ""map/galaxy"". You have different map sizes to choose from, the amount of players/factions (30+). the shape of the map, how many AI get to start off better than you, difficulty, and if you want to play Iron Man (Auto-save only). If you are looking to unlock achievements, then you need to play in Iron Man mode. If you want to use console commands or save whenever to be able to reload and make better decisions, then turn Iron Man off.
Now that you have the game ready to go it is time to start your adventure in an unknown galaxy. You get plopped into a random star system in the galaxy and begin your journey. Your AI robot will pop up and this is where you go full/tips only/none for tutorial. The robot I found to be a wonderful companion, I loved the dialogue and his duty to helping you understand the vastness of everything ahead of you.
You get a home planet, a starting spaceport, a construction ship, a science vessel, and a fleet of 3 corvette ships. You begin by surveying your system, then building another science vessel and surveying some more. In fact, you spend A LOT of time in this game surveying. You need to get out there and discover everything that is amazing and fun. You will run into some very interesting dialogues and quest lines from surveying. Itâ€™s important to know everything you can know about everything going on around you.
You also start the process of building and expanding your empire. You build a few mining stations in your system and mining nodes on your home planet to start that cash flow rolling in. There are 2 places you build. Upon the surface of any planets you have colonized, and in the orbit of stars and planets in the systems you explore. You need to find that healthy balance of energy and minerals to keep your empire going. 
Influence is another resource you get as well. It is very slow in the early game to accumulate and certain things like alliances will drain your influence even more. It is one of your most valuable resources. You need it to expand your borders, to recruit leaders, and to setup policies and edicts that help your style of play and help you adapt to whatâ€™s going on around you.
Your leaders are very important as well. You need them to govern your planets and sectors, to research new technologies, to man your science vessels, and to lead your armies. You start off with a few already but will soon need to recruit more with the influence you have gained. They level up as you use them and gain their own traits as well. They do age and die so they all have expiration dates which means you will always need some influence to recruit more. It's sad when you lose that scientist who hit 5 stars and basically excelled you through years of research by surveying tech in the vastness of space.
As you expand you begin to make contact with your neighbors. If you are lucky you run into more peaceful/tolerable aliens at first. This allows you to initiate the first move. Do you want to take them out or do you want to use them as a potential ally? There is only so much space and everyone is growing so eventually you will have to take someone out to be able to expand more yourself. 
With that being said, don't rush into any wars. You need to plan everything out before you launch an all-out assault. Make sure your fleet capacity is at full and you have an attack plan. Also be sure to have enough cash flow to afford the war. You can't fight if you are broke. Be ready for the AI to warp to your home system while you are in the middle of attacking theirs. The AI can be devious like that sometimes. War isn't easy and you spend a lot of time attacking then licking wounds then attacking again. 
Your first war is usually the easiest. Lesser techs and less to deal with. Once you get into alliances and federations, you start getting into warfare like you've never seen before. Things get crazy and the wars seem to last forever. You better hope you chose the right allies. My second war I was severely under-powered for and I lost horribly. It was basically game over and time to start fresh again.
This game takes some time to master and you will most likely lose your first few games before you start making head way but you won't care because you will be having fun the entire time.
This game offers a lot of depth and detail and a rich environment to experience it all in. You can easily lose hours upon hours to this game and care less about where the time has gone. If you are a fan of 4x strategy or even if you are playing for the first time, then this is the game for you. It is worth every penny and we still have more content to look forward too.			"

Controlling your science and construction ships becomes chore, with no decisionmaking involved what sovever. In battles tactics aren't involved aswell. Thats somewhat in the tradition of paradox games. But that doesn't cut it for me in a space title. I want awesome space battles ...
I played one game for 8 hours now, and i dont feel like i made any intresting choices. Compared to EU or Crusader Kings the game seems to be pretty plain. I don't feel like there is any reason to go back to it. I would have expected more from paradox and that they learned some more lessons from titles like Distant Worlds. If something the player has to do can be easily automated and does not involve decisionmaking, he shouldn't have to do it in the first place. At least in a 4x titel...			"
281990,76561197978088722,3,3,0,True,206.7,May 9,"What a fantastic game! 
Into-depth is immense, while gameplay is fun without hestitation as you could use pause. (Singleplayer, no MP tested yet)
First I did was to check allready offered mods on workshop. Right from release there are allready some availible...more to come, as Stellaris is fully modable. 
Clausewitz-engine, known from earlier historical games is totally fitting into Sci-Fi and 4X surrounding. Even while it's still 32bit. Seems developers and programmers know their job. 
No major bug encountered while testing (oh my, 6 hours :P ) and more to come. Really hyped by this great game, go and get you a copy.
I'd rate it 9/10 in comparrison to other availible 4X games and what it offers in future.
 
In fact I'm not sure we do 'brand' this game correct. I'd vote to say Stellaris is starting to enhance gameplay toward 4X-S with 'S' to state 'Simulation'. 
Reasoning: Stellaris has all what one wants from 4X, but with it's full scale long-term view it feels like shaping a whole society in a sci-fi frame. Additionally I know no other game that has that high focus on relations and diplomacy in such wide scale.
Surely there are some negative points left...UI scaling, in-depth may be overwhelming for some players, for some parts I would like to see more stuff. But all are either adjustable (UI) or of course modable, so it is up to us how we want the game tailored to fit each others very own wishes about.

281990,76561198007250663,3,3,0,True,88.9,May 13,Best 4x I have ever played.			
281990,76561198040425972,3,3,0,True,116.1,May 13,"Stellaris is exactly what I wanted in a space game, and it does an excellent job of meshing 4X with Grand Strategy.
What I love most, and expect many love most about the game, is the create your own species which allows you to choose your traits, FTL type (Warp, Hyperlanes and Wormholes), ship look, government type, species ethics, appearance even ship prefix. It will alter your entire game and your playstyle for that game. It's probably what makes Stellaris great to be honest.
After having set up your species and started the game, that initial burst of exploration and expansion is executed almost perfectly. Sending out your science ship to survey and explore other systems isn't just some mindless task of clicking from one system to the next as anomalies and research projects pop up in your situation log. This leads it to be far more immersive than any other 4X space game I know of at the moment, leading to weird and sometimes exciting events such as a brand of ultra-reactionary religious quacks breaking off from your empire to take a stand against your purging policy. Or your scientists finding a ceramic pot drifting around a sun that they just.. Can't explain. All this means that exploration isn't just ""oh. a planet to colonise, great. NEXT SYSTEM."" 
The land grab stage is also done incredibly well as you aim to cut off your opponents in a desperate grab for planets and minerals. Establishing frontier outposts and desperately trying to build colony ships in order to expand your borders. But make no mistake, there is no need for you to grab as much as you can. I've been three times the size of the AI and they've STILL had superior tech and equivelant fleet power/capacity to me. It's possible to build not just wide, but tall and that's done so well in the this game, in comparison to other games such as Sins of a Solar Empire where it's alllllll about the wide. 
Colonising is a relatively simple affair of sending your colony ship to X habitable planet, then settling there, waiting a year or two for it to be established and then bam, you have your colony; planets however aren't just things that set down borders, they'll be your main income for science/minerals/energy if you min/max one or the other. Every planet has a planet surface tab, which is divided into multiple squares consisting of as little as 5 up to 25 and this is where it starts to look a bit like Civ. Each tile has a natural resource within it which can either be exploited or ignored and built over to provide a different resource, in order to harvest said resource the tile requires an active pop be living on it; which are grown through the amount of food you have (Currently there is no point to having a surplus of food on a fully popped planet). Pops can be resettled between different planets within your core sector allowing you to keep your eithical bloodline pure.
Now, many 4X games descend into tedious micro-management of -every- planet and system that you own, which obviously a lot of people aren't all that in to. Some like spreadsheets, some don't. Stellaris attempts to alleviate this with something I've not seen in other space games as of yet, it allows you to break up your empire into ""sectors"", the number of sectors allowed is based on your population and planets owned. This sector is essentially an AI which will manage and govern the area you portion out to it. You can choose to assign each sector a governor who will convey specific bonuses to the entire sector. The sector doesn't just micromanage the planets though; you can allow it to redevelopment tiles on planets, and set it a specific function; such as military, minerals, research or credits. The sector AI will then attempt to do it's utmost best to supply as much of the chosen function as possible, except for military sector AI who will build military stations and strengthen their borders with space-station defenses, defending armies, etc. A lot of people have moaned that the sector AI seems woefully incompetent and doesn't really seem able to balance itself out; now this is incorrect, at the start you may notice that it is minus on energy credits for a while, this is because it doesn't have it's planets infrastructures built yet; simply pour minerals and energy into it and you'll see it even out, and eventually it'll even surpass itself. I've been provided with up to 400+ minerals by my sectors alone at times. They really do become incredibly good.
As time goes by it starts to morph into a GSG more than a 4X game, with an emphasis on war and diplomacy. They're not as fleshed out as a lot of people were hoping for. I was expecting what we got since I read all the DD's and didn't expect anything more. War is a very set in stone thing. You declare war for specific wargoals such as cede X planet, and liberate X planets. Then it's simply a march to your wargoal (gained through winning batles, capturing planets, etc). 90% of the time the AI will surrender and hand it over to you should you be utterly stomping them. If they're winning however, they will go on winning unless you surrender and give them your systems. This is a rather brutal AI in that respect. Many however have complained that the AI seems overly passive, and while this can be the case it's more luck of the draw and power than anything. They'll only go to war with someone they're superior over, which is just basic sense really isn't it.. And they're less/more likely to go to war based on their ethics and government aswell.
Diplomacy does need some work as it's rather basic right now, reminds me a lot of Sins of a Solar Empire with how basic it is, but I expect expansions and future content to change this. It's a relatively simple affair of alliance, rivalry, star charts. Trading is simply energy credits or minerals in an instant transfer or monthly. It's lacking basically, but it's more than sufficient for the game at current. Alliance blocks can turn into federations, with one nation that leads them which switches out every 5-10 years to a different nation.
Research and tech. Boy, did they outdo themselves with this one. This deck-of-cards research system is simply amazing. I've found tech in some games I didn't know existed, only to never see it ever again in any other game. Basically it's split into three categories; physics, society and engineering. And within each category you'll get 3 techs to choose from, you pick one, research it, and when you go back to picking 3 again, it'll have shuffled and present all new options. Some are weighted to appear simply so you can advance in the game, such as colony ships, and spaceport upgrades, which makes sense otherwise you could get shafted hard. If your science ship surveys debris and finds certain tech then it will appear as a permanent tech option, below the normal three, that you can pick regardless of how many different techs you research.
Overall, this is the game I've been waiting years for. It's exactly what I wanted in a Space 4X game, and it's growth into a GSG over time is well executed as it turns more to war/diplomacy. I want to note that this game isn't missing any features, it's just not fleshed out certain ones enough. Such as diplomacy, trade and managing factions. All of which are pretty basic right now, but that's to be expected when you think of the sheer scale this game has gone for. I'm all too happy to pay PDS money for DLC since I know that when they bring out expansion, it's actually an expansion for the game. I'm confident they'll continue to polish and add to this game for years and years to come just as they have for all their other titles/series: Victoria, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis'
Sorry if I missed anything, the games just got so many features and so much content, I'm sure I did miss something but hell, there's almost too much to write about! xD			"

281990,Forluhn,3,3,0,True,41.8,May 21,"Let's just get this out of the way, this is not CKII in space! Don't expect to have some dynamic family tree you need to manage with complex laws governing the nuances of land ownership. Though there does exist a leader tree it's rather simplistic at best, but don't let this deter you as the depth of this game is offered in different places. It's a 4X sci-fi game so with regards to basic game play elements there's nothing new here. However it's well worth mentioning where others in the genre fall short Stellaris seems to deliver. Of course it's not a perfectly polished game, but the core is here and it's a very solid one indeed!
The best way I can describe the feel of Stellaris it's like a combination of Endless Space and Stardrive. Yes both games had major flaws, but take those out combine the two and you have Stellaris; a solid game with hidden depth. The music, story, and atmosphere do a great job of painting the picture of a vast galaxy full of once was and current civilizations. I'm a huge advocate for having a solid musical score in my games (It's one of the reasons I've played guild wars 2 since launch). Stellaris' music is solid, nothing outstanding nor out of context. It's an original piece of grand sci-fi that suits the game. Some reviews claim the writing is lackluster, but personally I actually enjoyed reading the dialog. It's laced with just enough subtle humor to keep a smile on my face.
Obviously it's worth touching on some of the cons. First and foremost is the sound design. Like many others have noted the sound clips used for space battles are very tinny and just overall poor quality. Sometimes you zoom in on a fleet battle and it simply feels like toy ships flying around zapping each other with their toy ray guns. The A.I. is also rather suspect here as well. Though their diplomatic behavior is logical their handling of fleets during times of war is rather questionable at best. The good news is that not only have the developers acknowledged the A.I. flaws and plan to fix them, but the game has full mod support. Within the next month or two one should expect to see plenty of sound mods. 
Overall I think this is a great 4x sci-fi game, one that has brought me back to the genre for another ""just 5 more minutes"" type of session that usually ends up being far longer than intended.			"

Things I like:
-random races, this was a brilliant idea, and has ruined other games of this nature for me. Having random races makes the game more intriguing.
-graphics are very nice
-it is not too easy to figure out that you should complain it is simple and it is not too difficult that you canâ€™t figure it out
-ship designer is awesome
-games runs great on an AMD 8350, GTX 960, 16 gig system, which is a mid grade computer
- its Paradox, so get ready for tons of DLC
There is not much I do not like that Paradox has not addressed that they are fixing. For example, the battle stats after a battle were a complaint, but they are fixing it.
Diplomacy needs fixing, but I am sure it will be fixed.

Early game is fantastic and very fun. Tutorial too.
Mid game is boring and you start finding problems with the AI and stuff. AI is stupid. 
Don't know about the end game, haven't reached it yet.
My advice? If you buy this game, go get a mod that fixes the AI. Otherwise, I expect this game to become better in the following months, like most Paradox games. Also, primitive aliens can create the XCOM against you and you can infiltrate their governments and society ""They Live"" style and annex their planet after a few years.			"

I checked out one planet and, saw that at least 6 different species from my empire were living together on the planet with a relatively high happiness level.  It gave me a great sense of accomplishment.  I felt my conquests had all been worth it.  
About the only con for me is late game information overload seems to bog down the PC.  Running a high end PC/processer etc and, like Heart of Iron III the game seems to bog down with so many ships/stations etc. running around on the map.
I really look forward to more DLC. Would really like to see:
1.) More race types:  Insectoid(duh), Cetacean(Whales), Amphibian(Frogs), Silicon(Rocks), Icthyan(fish), Non Fungus Plants.  Honestly I seem to run in to a lot of space fungus races.
2.) More Ship Models to go with the expanded races.
3.) More Army Options.  Armored vs Infantry.  Maybe a bonus for landing armies of different types(Combined arms damage Bonus)
4.)More ships classes.  Combat Explorers.  A specific Carrier Hull for launching large strike craft formations.			"

The Good:
Well balanced tech trees between different empires and goverment types.
Rock - Paper - Scissors style ship customization where you actually need to think about your designs
Great storytelling, anomalies, ancient extinct races, etc... they really give you the sci-fi feel
Solid colonization and resource management mechanics.
AMAZING soundtrack, It's all the best parts of the Interstellar soundtrack and the Mass Effect soundtrack put together.
The Bad:
Diplomacy is lacking with very few options becides being rivals or allies.
Mid-game can be a little boring, but the end-game gets good again.

If you're a fan of the Masters of Orion series, you'll find a lot to like here. The spirit of those games lives here, but there are also a lot of parellels with modern 4x games. Stellaris feels like the rightful successor to Masters of Orion 2. The traditional ""Paradox"" learning curve in games like Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings doesn't apply to Stellaris. The game's UI is seemless but I highly recommend playing through the tutorial. 
Combat is enaging and there's no shortage of random aliens to dust it up with. Going up against other empires can be costly unless you have a clear technological and naval advantage. The diplomacy is very similar to Civ 4 or 5, but I've noticed a couple of glitches on the trade screen that I hope gets cleaned up in the coming weeks.

Stellaris is definitely a game that you will enjoy if you enjoyed past Paradox games and are fine with waiting on updates and buying future DLC to enhance an already solid gaming experience. At that time Stellaris has had enough patches and updates over the course of a year I will gladly give it my 9/10, but since that has not happened yet, I rank it 7/10 with a positive tone. Behold, my review!
PROS
--------------
1. The early game is very entertaining. It involves exploration, boldly going, etc. There is also a healthy dose of customization at the start to make a fun race of beings and then expand across the starts.
2. Beautiful soundtrack. That's pretty much 'nuff said'. I enjoyed listened for the first 7 hours even if it wasn't as good as that one CK II song (CK II nerds know what I'm talking about).
3. The game has a lot of neat little mechanics that haven't been featured in other Paradox games, but definitely fall in line with the evil stuff you can do in Crusader Kings. Population control is a big one, with forced relocation, purges, enslavement, and a whole host of other features in the game.
4. I really like the science system in the game. It makes it feel much more realistic in the terms of tech research, which also keeps the game fresh and prevents players from doing their stereptypical 'tech routes'. 
5. It's super easy to grasp and you can learn as you go!
CONS
--------------
1. Stellaris does slow down mid game. This is something that most Paradox games suffer from, making them hard to stick with for so long. I feel like the dev's promise to make the mid game fun was a little underserved. 
2. You will be waiting for more substance. Paradox loves to update their games, so it will take some time and money for the game to come into its own. 
3. It is an odd combination of Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, Civilization, and Sin of a Solar Empire. While the game has a lot of the good aspects of all these games, the hybrid pf GSG and 4X has the same pitfalls, such as taking a long time to get going and sometimes losing steam. 
Overall I feel as though this game deserves a positive review, but it will take sometime for it to come into its own.

It suffers the issues of most 4x games on release. 
Has bugs. Exploitable. Not fully fleshed out.
But it's better than most modern 4xs.
What's better. Maybe sots1 complete. Maybe civ 4 complete.
But it's at launch.
Totally worth it to wait a few months. I imagine the game will get astoundingly better.
The combat is A lot like sins save I can't give any commands other than retreat.
It's not my favorite model but way better than say galactic civ.
No instances. 
The ship design is a like a mix between sots and gc3.
It's simple but because the combat is sins like it works.
The level of detail there is functional.
There are a lot of hard counters.
But defenses can be mixed and matched.
There are some mechanics that are extremely cool.
Scientists have traits and these both can change the way they should be used and effect the tech comes.
There is not a tech tree exactly.
The tech mechanic used looks like it can be made to be expanded to be different for each race or resource available or a bunch of stuff.
Time will tell there but it looks like it could be dlc.
The game can suffer from forcing a certain style of lag to have the game be fun.
It can be really dull in some cases and a whole lot of fun in others.
For me I have to be a bit war hungry to keep the gang interesting.
The war aspect feels good to me.
I don't use simply huge armies to roll the target. 
The last war I was in I had three and the enemy still slipped a force through and started causing trouble.
I like that.
All aspects of the game require thought.
Bottom line... it's OK but can get really boring in doing play styles or situations.
Finding an enjoyable way to play makes it quite a lot of fun.
And it's going to get better. I would imagine over the next 3 years that this game will be the legendary game I have wanted since moo and mom.

281990,jervaise,3,3,0,True,229.9,May 19,"So, TLWR: The game has the potential to be one of the very best strategy games ever made. It is amazing. However it is unfinished.
Read some of the issues below:
Mid game issues, lack of inter and inner empire politics, unfinished alliance/federation dynamics, basically broken sector AI, shallow traits, imbalanced ethics, convergence divergence issues, unfinished factions system, very very little amount of scripted events, non-existent trade dynamics and mechanics, unfinished special resources system, lackluster UI, terrible invasion/ground army mechanics (needs a complete re-work), lack of depth in space battles (formations, tactics etc.), huge issues in FTL balance, imbalanced government types, lack of spirit and depth with fallen empires interactions, limited end game crises and bugs in their scripts, non-existent mid game crises, a huge ton of bugs (like orbital bombardment dynamics) and many many more (I have 46 hours played)
Still, I think the game is a solid 9/10 with all the issues mentioned above.
That is how good the game is. 
When they fix/finish the vanilla game and bring out patches+expansions, this game will be a golden classic. I can't wait for those.ï»¿			"

Slavery is insanely OP with massive gains for easily sorted downsides.
Only viable ship class is Corvette with max evade build. This fleet smashes all others in the game including high tech battleships.
No espionage in game as of yet. User interface is clunky & loads of other balancing issues.
The core game is ace and is made by a great developer who will sort this out. I still recomend the game but if your not fussed wait for a price drop and patches.			"

Pros:
+Great sound Track
+Interesting unfolding storylines
+Creating your own race
+Creating your own empire with its own ethics
+Finding many variations of empires and alien races
+Fun In the start of the game
Negatives:
-stale diplomacy
-Terrible war score system
-Glitchy combat
-Glitched end game disasters
-very few colony anomolies
-stale mid-game
-stale end game
-sectors that create more mircomanging than fixing
-Fallen Empires
SO going more in depth with the game now I really wanted to like the game, I hyped and I even Pre-ordered the game because I was so excited, hell I couldn't even play other games, but when I got my hands on it my heart sank. While the graphics are great for the type of game and what was promised sounded so sweet the game ended up being infested with bugs and stale boring game play. In the begining of the game it starts out very well with you using science ships to explore the galaxy and encounter empires, find anomolies and begin your first few colonies. Soon you continue to grow and grow untill you hit that 5 planet cap max, and then its down from there. The game then forces you to use sectors which while sounding good created more issues as sectors can by your own choice take either 25% or 100% of the resources it holds inside taking away from you, and it then auto manages planets, which it does terribly as it has been known to not upgrade planets correctly and creat a draw on your resources instead of adding too them.
We then soon reach the mid game where wars begin to errupt, and while on the small scale the system works magnificently it becomes terrible on the mid to large scale. If you have to many ships within a fleet the game becomes un-able to control them and when you enter combat ships do not fight correctly which if the enemy fleet glitches it becomes an easy fight, but if your fleet does it will stop in its tracks and refuse to fire its weapons correctly resulting in fleets that are double the size of an enemy to parrish despite having the perfect weapons for them. 
Diplomacy begins to become stale with the few amount of options and from the even fewer options for fallen empires. You can't even trade anything usefull to them as they refuse minerals and energy and won't trade anything but their own minerals and energy. With normal empires you can create alliances which work well surpisingly but then once it turns into a federation the game then it cycles through all nations inside of the federation for the next leader instead of voting a nation to lead as it should be. AI's can drag you into wars you dont want to be in but you can't vice versa. Soon enough empires have all joined into either alliances or federations resulting in a whole lot of nothing, other than the occasional glitch infested wars that happen occaisonally.
Then finally we hit endgame where you have most of the techs in the game. ONE of the endgame disasters in which other dimensional beings invade the galaxy which turns politics on its head which is intersting BUT AI refuse to fight back making it the player VS. galactic wide threat which guess what your rewards are for destroying the disaster? 40+ with every empire and you loose 5 of said 40 every one year, to give an example of how little that is an embassy goes up to +100. You destroy a galactic wide threat and get less influence than an embassy. Not only that but the territory they took does not receed at all making a permenant scar on the universe thats not supposed to happen.
I really wanted to love this game but I can't and if it takes DLC that I have to purchase from paradox to fix it, then I never will.			"

- Some bugs in it. But those will adress later i`m sure of it. 
- No need to cheat. Its simple and easy to manage. 
- Learning the game take up to 1 hour at most rest is easy to do. 
- Combat is simple and some tactics in fitting (you are a empire builder not a combat pilot) so do not buy it for that. 
- up to 39 AI and some extra`s (spoilers) 
- achivements only in ironman. And thats is how it needs to be in everygame.
- Bonus stuff and easter eggs (give you some good laughs about it)
- Mini campaigne in it (events you can follow or just ignore) 
- Great map 1000 stars and you know in every star there are planets you can discover or settel down)
- Game takes more then 20 hours to even get out of early stage at 1000 stars map. 
- No borring waiting. Like civ or most RTS games.
- Random decks (research are decks stage so every game is a little diffrend for you even if you play the same race)
- plenty of options to costum your race or edit your ship in every way you want however colouring your ship is not in this version perhaps a DLC? 
- Voice tut always fun to lissen even he change some text depend on your empire picking
- Lovely graphics just simple clean and how it needs to be.

Game bug (stuttering fix in 1 day) So ignore all reviews with that there are outdate. 
Also people with less then 10 hours in this game and having a negative or possitive review ignore it.

281990,eurolooney,3,3,0,True,26.8,May 10,"So I'm 8 hours into this and here are some unsolicited thoughts from someone who's played Paradox games for like thirteen years now:
Game is fantastic.
That isn't to say it's without its downsides right now -- barring a few bugs and balance issues that are pending (namely, slavery) -- its biggest shortcoming is the lack of depth in diplomacy (which I fully expect to be the first expansion). The midgame does, as IGN pointed out in their review, turn into a pretty massive grind in single-player, especially if you're in an area of space with not a lot of friendlies surrounding you. In multiplayer I imagine this is ten thousand times better just by virtue of the fact that player diplomancy is happening, but yeah.
In spite of that though, the game is really astounding, and I'm pleasantly shocked that Paradox launched a game this smoothly. The game concepts absolutely hit the nail on the head. Exploration is fantastic, POP management is cool, the characters are cool (though they could be fleshed out a bit more too), the favor of the races is really fantastic, and ship design is engaging for the theorycrafters. I've found myself making an actual fleet doctrine in this game, and it's been working out.
Overall this is going to be a game, like the rest of the Paradox line, that I play for hundreds of hours.
My biggest gripe from my current game though: when vassalizing an empire in a war, I REALLY REALLY wish it would automatically switch that empire's government over to your ethos. I'm not talking about all the POPs, I mean the government itself. It's impossible for this vassal empire to have a positive opinion of me because their ethos is diametrically opposed to mine... you would think that the process of vassalization would involve installing a puppet government of your own choosing.

281990,76561197982188183,3,3,0,True,76.1,June 16,"Stellaris – It’s a pretty fun 4x game.
My first and current play through has been going really well. I started with my awesome cat people of the ‘Fevarian Imperium’ who have the ‘Fanatic Xenophobic’ and ‘Militaristic’ traits. Unfortunately due to an oversight they have a preference for colonizing tundra worlds, of which are few and far in-between.
Anyway, I’ve managed to expand out and colonize my twelfth world of which had a copper age civilisation already inhabiting it. This is fine I thought, I’ll just establish a colony and bring them into the Fevarian Imperium, heck when I get the ability to ‘uplift’ them, they can be given an entire system to themselves (Found a system with 3 continental words just perfect for them but not me). I even began theorising a way of relocating them early so I can fully colonise their world.
Apparently my catfolk populations disagree. Two factions developed, one wants to enact an extermination policy and wipe out the natives, the other wants to enslave and prohibit the natives from breeding – essentially letting them die out. My first attempt to nullify the factions, failed and triggered a civil war. The Extermination faction controls the planet in question + 5 others, while the Extermination through slavery faction controls the rest.
Hence I’m watching my formally fanatically united society ravage itself in what has been a crippling civil war, all because they couldn’t agree on a method of extermination.
10/10 – Would Underestimate how Fanatically Xenophobic societies work.
PS - Non Vanilla review, used mod that changed how factions work.			"

Very easy to use interface. Zooming in and out, scrolling side to side is a breeze. So much to do! Its a very detailed and indepth experience. You can setup at the beginning of each game up to 1000 star systems and several alien races to inhabit them. You can also customize different races to your play style. The only knock I have on actaul gameplay is the battles really arent very attractive. Hopefully they will improve a little bit on this as the updates and DLC follow as expected.

They were so primative that they still were not united under a world government, let alone guided by the one true faith.  Our scientist-monks suggested we may learn from close but covert study of the natives, but once you've prodded one fleshy being, you've prodded them all.  Instead, I would send in the missionaries with heavilly modified bodies to infiltrate their governments and bring them into the fold ""willingly"".
After years of work (and one missionary deciding to ""go native"" and run away with a hoo-man), we finally welcomed the people of Sol into our benevolent family.  All was well, but there were some whom the light did not wholly illuminate.  I felt that the desire to bask in the light of community and follow the calling of One would bring them into line, but while I was concerned with distant battles with a breakaway sect, sentient crystal beings, and space chickens, the hoo-mans were organizing mass rallies and eventually the riots became open rebellion.  Our peace guard barred the doors of the Temple of Glorious One on Sol, and an expedition was rapidly raised, a huge army of Penitant Troops and an equally massive force of armed spacecraft.  We set out to right this wrong.
Once we reached Sol system, we received a last transmission from the Temple as the rioters penetrated its defences and destroyed it.  With heavy hearts I ordered the Penitant Troops to land and bring order to the lawless.  Upon reaching high orbit, the transports learned to their horror that the hoo-mans had built their own fleet in secret...nearly as large as ours...and taken command of the defensive station rotating around the planet.  Every transport blew or burned up, landing on the planet as scattered ashes, soon after followed by our great fleet.  Three corvettes and our War of Peace leader were the only survivors.
We had sought to bring the people of Sol into Unity, to teach them about our faith and higher technology.  In return, they doomed our own empire.  Now something...large...is coming our way.  It stretches across space and every star it passes goes dark.  We pray to the One, may She guide us...

There are several things that also make this 4X game stand out among the crowd:
- Instead of early game colony rush it's mainly about exploring, with combat being of rare occurence and many planets being uninhabitable. It takes a while before you are threatened by anything big so the starting pace is comfortable and goes up smoothly.
- Instead of midgame spam of the same set of buildings on every planet there is a 'sector' layer that lets AI governors take care of many of the trifles on multiple planets at once while you are focusing on the bigger picture.
- Late game uncontrollable blobbing is countered by a quite competent AI uniting against a common threat as well as galaxy-wide catastrophic events that can either be triggered by some empire or by chance making it much harder for anyone hit by them
In a way this game is very much like Master of Orion 3, except with a good interface and much more polished gameplay.
There are however some downsides.
Much like with any Paradox game, pre-dozens-of-DLCs, base game suffers from getting to a point where there's not much new stuff left to discover, repetition and some weird and obvious design shortcomings. The example of the latter is sectors never rebelling, which is strange, considering that they act like ""duchies"" and in other Paradox games not keeping them happy leads to the trouble.
But despite that the game is great, get it now.			"
281990,jinevere,4,5,0,True,53.4,May 20,"Studio known for it's historical grand strategy games decides to shake up the 4X-genre. Release is surprisingly smooth, a lot of content is left out or is just too shallow to be interesting (such as diplomacy and internal politics) which makes mid game and especially late game repetitive and quite bland. There aren't really much interaction between game mechanics and with previously mentioned issues, this stomps emergent storytelling - which in my opinion is the best spice in Paradox GSG games. Every now and then Stellaris feels like it's from different developer, but smooth and logical gameplay remind the game is crafted by Paradox with love. Looking past the disappointment, Stellaris is filled with creativity and great ideas and it's early game is most refreshing 4X in years. While mid and late parts of the game feel sloppy, they have their unexplainable charm. Stellaris should've been named: ""Sci-fi Tropes: The Game"".
Freedom in creating your own species and empires is astounding and gives huge replayability. There is difference if you're playing xenophile, pacifist birds or if you're on a militaristic crusade through the galaxy. The game even properly manages to handle multispecies Empires. Stellaris has a sturdy foundation for Paradox to build a classic, a new milestone for the space 4X-genre. 
Paradox has already published their plans with next upcoming patches, which will (hopefully) flesh out the game. On basis of their plans and current state of the game, Stellaris was released a few months too early. 
+ Engaging early game, exploration and expanding

+ Mods only not supported, but encouraged
+ Innovative, stands out in a stale genre of space opera strategy games

- Diplomacy is simple, boring and almost useless
- Internal politics are nominally there, population system is just a faded shadow of Victoria II's one
- No trade mechanics, resources are almost meaningless

Theirs currently a massive bug where one of the 'end game crisis' cannot be beat. Basically a re-invented tyranid swarm eats and destorys every planet they contact, they are fun to fight and you get a real sense of achivement once you defeat their space forces but you cannot in any way recapture the planets from them and you have you leave a fleet (1 half decent battleship) above each of their planets to prevent them rebuilding perminantly. When this is the better part of over 20 battleships and having a grand fleet to go around clensing the systems the draw on your ecconomy is crippling and unplayable, the AI don't help, infact they are the opposite of helpful they want to start wars and conquer other ai while you alone deal with the scurge(if your playing right now and the scurge appear in your game I reccomend leaving any federation you may be in if you are forced to fight them, as you will be alone and unlike me being in an alliance with the AI unable to veto wars).

281990,76561198122002676,4,5,0,True,30.0,May 9,"What follows is my review of Stellaris Day 1 version;
Stellaris is a 4X, Grand Strategy RTS hybrid.
It mixes the structure and exploratory nature of 4X's with the strategic depth of the Grand Strategy genre.
The game is set in 2200 with players taking control of an empire they can choose to create themselves, or pick from a range of pre-setup empires provided in game.
Your goal is to take your empire from the dawn of discovery of FTL travel, to exploring the galaxy, greeting new friends (incl. Blorg), exploiting rivals and in the end exterminating every threat as you see fit, until your empire reigns supreme.
Stellaris manages to somehow open up for the eXploring in 4X, and does so a lot in my opinion.
What you get is up to 1000 star massive galaxies where you can spend hours upon hours exploring, meeting new friends (or enemies) and getting caught off guard by the numerous events that unfold in the galaxy;
I had the fortune, in my first playthrough, of finding a '13 Energy Credit' '4 Mineral' star system about 1 hour into the game, and boy did I celebrate. I thought I was invincible with my new found wealth and I promptly sent my science ship out to investigate and complete the survey. 
A few months into surveying my science ship, encountered a vessel in distress. Being the nice person I am, and having chosen a pacifist ethos, I opted to assist the poor souls who were crying out for help, and thus I put a stop to surveying while I researched the distress signal. In the end however, my science ship was unable to help, the event failed and I mourned the passing of those who cried for help.
About 2 seconds later I get a warning; My science ship was sending a distress signal. ""WHAT?!"" I thought, ""I didn't encounter any hostile aliens, I just dealt with the distress signal, what the hell is going on?"". 
It turned out my science ship crew had been infected somehow, trying to help the distressed vessel. I watched in horror as my highest ranked scientist, and all the scientist aboard tore into each other, killed their kinsmen and blew up the ship, in a sudden onset of insanity.
So there I was, mere months after the elation of finding all the resources I could ever want, seeing my only science ship get blown to pieces. I cannot properly explain the distress I felt as I realized that I didn't have enough minerals to build a new science ship, and that one event had set my empire back months, if not years in surveying, experience and resources.
Few hours into the game, and I already felt like I had found Midas' treasure, and promptly been stabbed in the back by a wolf in sheeps clothing. I learned a hard lesson that day; You can't trust anyone in space.
I'm not sure what I truly expected from Stellaris after seeing all of the hate the game was getting for problems with pacing, slaves and, according to some youtubers, performance issues. 
Having had some time with the game myself now, I can honestly say that it has exceeded my expections in every aspect. It has been a long time since I've had this much fun with a game.
I've been an RTS fan for a long time, but I must admit that this game has truly opened my eyes to how immersive and challenging a game can be.

I was wrong - very wrong.
I found it hard to keep playing the other 4X games. I personally thought they were very complicated and had a tough time with them. Stellaris is not like that. The gameplay is smoother and it's so much easier to pick up the complexities. I'm definitely loving this game and all it has to offer. From making my own fully customized species, naming every single leader and constantly choosing how to upgrade all of my ships I found this game perfect.
I recommend it to all of the people who enjoy 4X games - but still find them lacking.

That being said, it helps to get into the game if you have a hard-on for xenopolitical and biological systems.
Late game does get a little stale because your options are to either take over the galaxy, or just keep passing time and developing your technology - both of which take a long time and aren't too exciting.

**********EDIT*05*24*2016***************************
It has been told, but after a tremendous start, the game tends to become quite dull after three or four hours. In fact, it is as such: Once you've overcome most of the problems that can appear at the beginning of your play (creating an army powerful enough to defend yourself, expanding your borders, producing a fair amount of enrgy and minerals), most of the 10-25 hours of gameplay that will follow will consist in only two possibilities: waging war against one of your neighbours, or spawing colony ships in order to expand your realm. This, and nothing else.
  So, as much as I enjoyed a few plays, I have to admit that I'll desperatly wait for the upcoming patches to put some flesh on the core of the gameplay. Or else, this game will gather dust until the first DLC - if it's good enough.			"

As natural for such a recent release and a Paradox game in particular, not all of the mechanics are yet in place and DLC are sure to follow soon-ish. For example the only way to win is via war right now.

The early game is excellent, mid-game has been a huge time sink. I've put 20+ hours into the game so far (at the time of this review) and and am no where near finishing a game. The sector concept, AI, and re-balancing of ship types needs to be improved upon for this game to become the 'go-to' space strategy game.

281990,teros001,5,7,0,False,139.2,May 22,"First off:  This review is likely to change to a positive recommendation in the future when Paradox has fixed some of the bugs and added content that they've promised.  If you're curious about this game then I recommend you come back in a month or two after the game has been patched to 1.1.  If you're really eager to play this game then its definitely fun enough to buy, but you probably own it already.
So what's the problem with Stellaris?  The first few hours of the game are fantastic.  Crafting your own empire and setting out into the stars to slowly expand your understanding of the galaxy, discovering secrets, and basically roleplaying your spieces is a great experience.  The galaxy feels both big and deep; ancient civilizations, pre-ftl species, and unusual technologies are all waiting to be found, and quest chains help to make your playthrough feel a bit more unique.  It's all very exciting.
Unfortunately, Stellaris doesn't feel fully completed.  For one, the transition into the mid game is absolutely terrible.  While this is a Paradox game and you should expect to have stretches of time where you're not doing too much, the game abruptly goes from one with interesting sci-stories and roleplay into...nothing.  Virtually nothing happens outside of interacting with other empires, which is a problem because these interactions feel clumsy with the currently lackluster diplomatic actions (federations and alliances are simply not that fun).  Paradox has already acknowledged this midgame problem and is working to fix it.
But even if you get past the mid-game and head into the late game (where there are events to help spice the game up), issues remain.  The game is riddled with bugs.  I'm almost 100 hours in and I haven't been able to finish any questline involving a ""Precusor civilization"" because the game bugs out each time.   When dealing with one of the late game threats, the game simply...removed them.  The quest log remained, but I could never finish it and advance the ""story"".  When the game shipped you literally could not remove one of the end game threats from planets.  These kinds of events are common and frustration, and they make the game feel empty, particularly when compared to how it starts.
On the plus side, the game is still decent despite its flaws.  Expanding your space empire and deciding what to do with xenos can be fun, and as you can see I've put a lot of hours into it despite its flaws.  Nevertheless, be prepared for a lot of things that just don't feel completed on top of what I've mentioned (winning conditions, sectors, broken achievements, etc.).  Based off of Paradox's hsitory and their communications so far I'm confident the game will be fixed.  But for now, hold off.  It'll be a lot more fun when you play a completed version of the game that is full of unique events and quests that actually work the way they're supposed to.			"

This includes not only the 4 X's, but also diplomatic and scientific issues and work.
This is a rather challenging game (its not just ""easy""), however, the tutorials are quite complete and thorough. It will take some time to get used to and learn how the game mechanics work. It does not feel like work, though.
Those who already know the publisher and producer of this game also know, that they are famous for rather complicated and challenging games. Stellaris might be considered one which is easier to get into (compared to other games).

But, I have been playing one single player game ever since Stellaris shipped: the Nova Terran Imperium (diaspora humans ready to conquer the galaxy to make it safe for humanity!)
Traits: Natural Engineers, Sedentary, Strong, Resilient
Ethics: Militarist, Spiritualist, Individualist 
Gov't: Military Junta, later changed to a Martial Democracy
I recently looked at my leader, who was recently re-elected for my now Martial Democracy. She is Gabriela Ibanez, a Nova Terran ((human)) who is a champion of the people and resilient. She is also 228 years old.
Now, whether my leaders are Xenos or Nova Terran, they usually die around 90. Resilient helped her, but there is nothing that I know of that explains why she has lived for 2 centuries. It could be a glitch, or as my father mentioned, it could be extragalactic invaders infiltrating my government. ((seeing some of the other events that can happen in this game, such as the not-tyranids showing up at one point, I wouldn't be surprised.)) Either way, looking at her age, she is just as old as the Imperium itself.
She remembers the birth of the Imperium, when it incorporated the Tropical Eruxo into the empire by infltrating their primitive government and preparing them for integrating.
She remembers the time when the Imperium tried to incorporate another primitive race, the Yssravanar, only to have a rogue agent try to hamper our efforts because of a woman. She also remembers the decision to bombard an entire city to kill the agent.
She remembers the first ever war the Imperium fought against the Artic Immutharan, how our point defence technology countered their missile technology and led to the complete conquering of their empire.
She remembers the massive expansion to the galactic south, leading to the Imperium becoming the largest power in the entire galaxy.
She remembers when the Imperium, a Military Junta that only allowed humans to vote and lead, changed to the Republic, a Martial Democracy that allows Xenos to vote and become leaders.
She remembers the countless wars that have brought the Republic prosperity.
She remembers the psychic technolgies that have empowered the fleet and the armies to the point that we rival the Fallen Empires.
She remembers the Scourge that came into the opposite side of the galaxy, and the plans to wipe them away like the plague they are.
And now, she shall lead the Republic of Nova Terra, with its Psi Legions and the Conquistador Fleets, to conquer a Fallen Empire to prove how strong the Republic is.

Been playing them since I was about 6 years of age or less and they still have countless hours of my life dedicated to them. The company behind Stellaris has already a fantastic lineup of amazing games they have released over the years which are full proof amazing RTS's you cannot go without. 
That being said, Stellaris is no exception. Most of the reviews on here seem bland as they talk about the lack of updates or things to do mid game, but with how many options there are in the game already people need to use their minds and just create their own events. Maybe enlighten a hostile proto race, get two people to go to war, create new races and different socioeconomic sectors etc etc. Just because the game doesn't have literal events later on does not mean it's not worth it. Name one RTS that literally has events the entire time that are unique and randomly generated that aren't super short games. 
They even pledged to keep releasing updates to it over time for free instead of making people purchase for DLC and other stupid things that I think people are just too relaxed with. They are a godsend and this game has already taken a huge part of my day away from me each day and I don't regret it. 
Specifically I like how this game is not just a Overcome and swallow game but more of a diplomacy and exploration/Overcome/Swallow game. It's all how someone plays it. Have not found too many scifi RTS games that focus on the bigger picture rather than just the combat aspect of space empires etc etc.			"

Friend starts as a race of lizard people being militaristic science directorate, and I start as a race of space hawks in a science directorate or ""One for all and all for Science!"" as we would say. 
We start on a 4 arm spiral galaxy as neighbors on the same arm. He is North and I am South. We agree to expand in our already established directions, cue ""I got your 6 buddy!"" and immediately establish each other as rivals for increased influence gain while simultaneously agreeing to research agreements, migration, and ship access  because abusing game mechanics with friends is what the cool kids do. #Alliancesareexpensiveandforchumps
We then set about exploring in our respective directions. The South is free and clear and I begin expanding my soon to be mighty science empire, friend explores north and is instantly stopped by another empire . (It is to be noted this is my friend's third campaign since release and he consistently has problems with avian empires. Friend is possibly a space racist.) 
Friend finds out the blocking empire is cyclops parakeets, 
""Lieutenant engage rage emitters!""
Friend screams expletives while trying to place wormhole generators to expand East or West onto the 2 or 4th arm of galaxy. He is out of reach by the width of 1 cursor. 
More expletives. 
""Sir! Rage emitters are at max capacity, we can't sustain these levels without risking a full meltdown!"" 
Meanwhile I casually expand South unimpeded by other empires. Free space as far as the empire can see.  Planet after planet colonized for the glory of Science. My population is happy and rapidly growing.
Friend attempts to squirrel around parakeets with frontier outposts because his fleet is tied up dealing with internal pirates and factionless enemies to declare all out war. His first outpost reveals a superior armed Cthulhu race North of parakeets. 
Friend's expletives and frustration enter into the realm of myth.
""Sir! We are seeing near Chernobyl level readings! WE CAN'T HANDLE THIS KIND OF SITUATION!""
""Calm down lieutenant, we will make it through this crisis if I have anything to say about it."" 
Oh Captain, my Captain.
I continue to expand in the name of Science, all glory be onto it. researching an anomaly grants me 4 free raider ships into my humble fleet and use it to assist friend with his internal enemies. Friend is able to focus on crushing parakeets between him and Cthulhu. 
The glory of Science transcends borders as my friend begins receiving extra population from my now rapidly growing hawks. 
Science knows no racism.
Expanding South reveals my first major obstacle in the form of a Slug race fallen empire. Science must never be impeded, it must continue to reveal the mysteries of the universe.The head of the hawks' scientific council, Sciencey McScienceface, leads research for the warpath ahead. The hawk people focus research on any weapons they can get their hands on. The hawks and lizard march on. Their battle-cry, ""Science for the Science God!""
10/10 Would praise Science and stick friend between a rock and a parakeet hard-place again.

281990,raynerderine,6,9,0,False,44.0,May 20,"If ever there were a game I wished you could give a thumbs sideways to, it's this one. I'm not recommending it mainly to counteract its current ""very positive"" status. Because many of those reviews are ssimilarly hesitant.
I like it. It's good. But like many people, I was hoping for more grand strategy in space. What I got was in many ways Endless Space but tweaked. It's really, on the whole, quite a simple game. If you've played any 4X game, you understand 95% of the systems in Stellaris. And it is a 4X game, not a grand strategy game, and a not particularly complex 4X game at that.
There are no dyanstic mechanics, the variations in races aren't nearly enough, superficially or mechanically, as they diverge.  Diplomacy isn't fully fleshed out, federations and alliances are far too limited. There are maaaaaaaaaaaaaany bugs. Alien races all seem to contact you telling you they're establishing embassies with themselves when they mean with you, events are constantly filled with placeholder text and missing entities.
I won't go too in-depth on all the problems or even LIST all the problems, as that woudl take a while - it is a big game after all. But to further elaborate on one of the big ones: you can form alliances and federations with other races. This is the most basic thing they could do, really. Alliances are just, ""Hey, we've got each others' backs, so step off."" That's it. Nothing else to them. In fact, they actually LIMIT your diplomatic options with alliance members.
Federations are the next step. They're the UN. Except there are no resolutions to pass. The president rotates. They can declare war and design a new federation ship. And that boils down to, ""Oh, I'm the president. WE'RE AT WAR WITH MY NEIGHBOR; I WANT THEIR ♥♥♥♥.""
There is no way to change rules and regulations for federations. You can't be a peaceful or warlike one, forbidding instigation of conflict or demanding contribution to a federation fleet, for example. You can't change the rulership style. There's so much potential, but it ends up so frustratignly limited. Your federation ends up being whatever the rotating president at the time wants it to be. This works a bit better in multiplayer, I'm sure, but ♥♥♥♥, who has the time for that. Not me. I play singleplayer. I have a job.
In addition, bugs and missing features aside, some of the features that do exist are just silly. You need to occupy a planet to get someone to cede it. Sort of makes sense in theory, but... why? Isn't bombarding it from orbit kinda enough? Especially if the enemy is desperate for peace?
On the whole, it's a disappointing game, but not unfun, and it's a solid base. With modding support and, hopefully, Paradox's general tendency to provide big, worthwhile updates, fixes, and DLC, it will be worth buying and playing for many many hours a year from now or so.
As it is now, don't make my mistake. Be patient; wait for fixes and more content and more mods. Play or replay Endless Space. That's what it makes me want to do right now.			"
281990,XPsycho87,6,9,0,False,40.5,May 18,"Well....
;tldr wait a few weeks/months for updates, patches, hotfixes or a sale.
I like Stellaris but it's not yet done and the hype about this game is way to high.
Game runs solid (until endgame, boy this slowdown)
32 bit version only!? Cmon...
AI is mostly stupid as spacebread.
Diplomacy is more or less irrelevant, brute force ftw.
UI is meh, needs some extra buttons, bigger window size
Language translation (other than english or swedish maybe) are mediocre
Well, it's a shiny little gem, only needs some months polishing.
Taken from Shop-page: 
Deep & Varied Exploration. 
-there are many ""quests"" to be completed by your explorers or researchers, but after a time, they get pretty boring and repetive.
Enormous procedural galaxies, containing thousands of planets. 
-when you saw 10, you saw them all
Explore Anomalies with your heroic Scientist leaders. 
-Leaders are just temporary (they die after x ingame years) soulless bonuses applied to some aspects of the game.
Infinitely varied races through customization and procedural generation. 
-And 90% of them are always agressive towards you.
Advanced Diplomacy system worthy of a Grand Strategy Game. 
-mhh...I might search again since I only found a basic diplomacy screen like every other 4x has.
Ship Designer based on a vast array of technologies.

Stunning space visuals.

This game is a fabulous eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate game. The exploration is especially engrossing. This reminds me of a real time MOO2, which is a darn good thing.
The game is far(!) easier to pick up and play than another Paradox Interactive game, Crusader Kings II.
The biggest CON of I note for this game so far is that it is going to keep me from getting all the sleep I need.			"
281990,76561198082921868,6,9,0,False,53.2,May 16,"I am a huge fan of Paradox games and eagerly awaited the release of Stellaris. At first glance it was a wodnerful game with the complexity similar to other Paradox games. The more you play however the more it falls short and despite despartely wanting to like the game I have come to the realization that it was released to early and subsequent fixes to the problems will be released as DLC. Issues found with admitedly on 50 hours of game play are:
Game speed slows down to a crawl in late game large maps.
     Some sluggishness to be expected but this amount makes the game unplayable.
War Mechanics are bugged for certain wargoals. 
     Vazzalization wargoal requires an player to vassalize the enemy to prevent them from gaining warpoints. As a result unless you biltzkreig them at the begining they and their allies will be able to defeat you. This is with the defender winning no major fleet engagements, conquering any planets or defending their home system,
No Space Marines 
     A major source of content for most science fiction novels and games is completely absent from this game. The ground forces of Stellaris are limited to transport ship troops on shuttles that explode almost instantly upon any engagment. As a result transporting your troops is a cat and mouse game requiring vast amounts of micro managment to get your troops across the stars. You are even unable to have a fleet comprised of both main naval ships and transport ships. Until this is fixed I will be playing other games. Bring in the invading marines that are onboard warships. Allow ships to fit a module that would allow x amount of marines to be on board.
Government Evolution
     You would think that a game with many different speicies, government forms and ethos's would allow you to adapt to your current gameplay by allowing your government to reform. This is not the case. Why not allow for example a military dictatorship that expands and incorporates multiple different species to reform into a true democracy? It makes sense and could be managed very well by the game. 
Faction System
     Similar to the rebel system from other Paradox games the faction system is for monitoring the discontented portion of your population. Rebels can oppose the government for many different reasons but by and large are easily defeated when they rebel. Realistically speaking this is wonderful because if one planet rebels against a intergalatic empire it would be easily put down. Unfortunately this raises the question as to why Paradox put the mechanic in in the first place. It feels woefully unfinished to me and the methods for quiteing factions is vastly uncreative.
All in all I am very dissapointed with the released version of Stellaris. Hopefully these bugs will not matter to you but for me the game seems like a sloppy version rushed out of production.			"
281990,76561198065870221,6,9,0,False,15.4,June 29,"I don't recommend this game yet but let me tell you first what the game is about: basically you're to collect resources so you can build starports, which in turn you can use to build spaceships. Resources are found by exploring planets, colonizing some whilst building facilities on other planets. In the mean time you'll research for different types of technologies. It's much like in many other games such as civilization and whatnot. Besides tech, you're to manage your government type and various traits, including choosing the right leadership and commanders for your needs. Then, eventually you and your opponents have expanded which means war. Either you're alone of through diplomacy you can form alliances. That's the basic idea.
The main goal is conquest, but events may be triggered by exploring anomalies in space. Events are like miini-adventures which may lead to great rewards and sometimes lead to disaster. This is a super fun idea. But here's my first complaint: more events are needed. After only a few runs you've seen it and done it all.
It's a very accessible game fast. Diplomacy is really simplified and in general I don't think the game is that challenging. So that's the second downside. I have read that some players have done and seen it all and lost interest already! I fear I'll go in that same direction as well. The game has its bugs. But the worst culprit is the gun and ship or combat system, which is simply flawed. 
During a battle, the ships just storm forward only to end up in a big furry ball and then the ships are shot in order by its size. But you can't focus fire or micromanage a battle at all. Everybody shoots at everybody in all directions.
Basically combat is broken. It has been acknowledged by many others too. As long as Paradox doesn't fix this, then this game is pretty much useless. Also this game needs more content. I mentioned the lack of events already, but also enemies do not use their diplomatic options that well, nor does the game offer more  creative ways to conquer the space. It all boils down to extermination, more or less.
Finally there's the clunky interface. For example you can fit various weapons on your ships but the weapons aren't sorted by type or anything. You also can define new ships (outfits) and save them. But again, you can't group it in an interface so it becomes immediately apparent whether it's a support ship, a anti-shield ship, or anti-armor. And so forth. It's also hard to follow how your colonized planets are doing and you name it. It's all kinda messy. So far the interface has been my biggest enemy in space so far.
I regret I spent money on it. Can't recommend it yet. Haven't read anything in dev blogs which would give me hope, so skip this one. Hate to say it as I looked so much forward to this. I suspect Paradox is going to add the much needed content through DLC""s, which would make this game only more expensive.
If new patches improve things, I will update this review! Again, it has potential but not worth your money right now.
Note: edited slightly because of the arrival of patch 1.2. New patch corrects a few things but also added a small armada of new bugs and problems.			"
281990,76561198029341938,7,11,0,False,1.4,May 23,"At first I was hesitant to write a review with having such a short amount of time played, but after seeing the other negative reviews and their significantly larger number of hours played, as well as watching a lot of YouTube gameplay before making my decision and going for a refund, I now feel confident with giving this game a thumbs down. 
Now, don't get me wrong: The game isn't bad. It's just severely lacking in content, which is a common Paradox strategy, as it opens up the door for them to bleed your wallet dry in the future with great quantities of DLC. Which is fine, because with every DLC the game becomes better. But it means that the base game, at the time of release, is often barebones, and that is the case with Stellaris. 
The game is basically this: explore new systems, colonize them, build structures to harvest resources from them, build a massive fleet to wipe out whatever unknown force is occupying the next system, and then explore/colonize/build/etc in that one, one by one until you win. There's very little depth to civic administration, and combat is just throwing numbers at smaller numbers and watching as attrition plays its part. There's very little substance to the gameplay, and in the mid to late game, it becomes an almost unmanageable micro-fest with more time spent paused than playing (unless you're REALLY good at micro). 
As it currently stands, it's not worth it. In 6 months to a year, sure, there will be new content which makes the game better. But for now, hold off on it, unless you wanna get it on the summer sale. And even then, be warned.			"

How to review this.... well, I started playing it on a thursday if memory serves and oly played about a half hour... thought meh, its okay..     
Then, friday night happened...   I played for what felt like a while, realizing that this game had a TON of depth of stategy to it, suddenly I had a terriblle pain in my head and I could hear birds singing outside... I had played for 11 hours... straight.  
This game is Awesome.   the best RTS game ive ever played bar none. For me the funnest part of any Conquest rts style game is the empire building that happens at the start long before the wars happen... this game never really seems to end, you are not going to kill of an entire enemy civilization in one fell swoop, much as it would be in reality you must manage your forces well to both defend home sectors, collect resources, trade, produce, and Occupy planets that you have taken over. you will not play this game in 1 sitting, ive played 53 hours in only 5 sittings and Am only now realizing the depths of this, it has not yet become routine and my strategy has been forced to adapt continually to survive. I was almost destroyed by an enemy ( who posed as a friend and geve me minerals for a looong time only to suddenly and unexpectedly exploit my boarder permissions ) only to gain the upper hand with a battleship and a awesome skilled commander ( thank you spider warrior named Hasooon ), that civilization is now a vallal under my own and hates me passionatelly bet cant do ♥♥♥♥... I own everything of theirs and when they try to revolt BAM install my slave governer and enslave the whole planet, eventually they will learn to not revolt.  
the game happens 1 day at a time... your governers get old and wiser and then ( sometimes at bad bad times ) die.. I had a big fleet fighting off some invaders and didnt realized the notification that my commander in charge had died.. I was buisy scouting new galaxys only to realize that 90% of my ships in that fleet were destroyed. :(   the A.i. is unforgiving and the game is IMO birlliant.  If you like strategy games, THIS is the game you should get right Now... but be warned, my sleep has severely suffered as a result.    it does have a learning curve, and seems like a lot to take in at first but its actually pretty easy to learn... and it has yet to get stale, new things keep happening that keep me thinking and on my toes....  this is the game Ive long awaited.   Elite Dangerous would benafit by examining this engine instead of having a billion systems with nothing at all happening and nothing to do but grind grind grind..      
Stallaris.  
Build buildings, manage populace, design and build your own ships, expand your boarders and empire, negotiate treatys and conflicts, hire and fire generals, governers, admirals, scientists, manage research tech, manage fleets and starports, I could literally go on and on and on forever about how much depth the strategy has... also you dont necisarilly need to win by war means, you could be defensive and win by having the majority of the planets and systems.. ( which you can explore and terraform also )    
This is actually the longest review Ive ever done on a game ever..    buy this game..   AND it feels like its polished and clean unlike so many recent games released in the past years.   
This is quickly becoming my favorite game... now, I just need to remember to set an alarm to stop playing cause it hurts my brain to play game for such long periods... but even with the brain pain when i turn it off and go away I find myself in my day to day wondering ""should I destroy that ignorant mushroom looking civilization for takin g over that sector i wanted ? ""    and how will I do so... maybe i will wait for another 100 years..    So far more than 2000 years have gone by on the time scale...   ive not yet tried the online and am not entirely sure how it will work so I cant comment there, but I have faith that it will also be awesome.   
UPDATED...  
well, its too long.. sorry but multiplayer is rediculous. also the game gets really really buggy towards the end of game when there is too much happening. not slow, actual bugs.. like  buttons dont do what they are supposed to type bugs.. this annoys the hell out of me that I had to play a game for 30 hours over multiple days just to discover this. also diplomacy means nothing against AI, and you will war just Cause... and when you do you can blob your entire Fleet together and just go kill off the enemys mining platforms and it4 cripples their entire empire... they never think to do this to you though, instead opting for planetary invasions even if they are doomed to fail.  just for fun, yesterday I made war with 14 different species in the galaxy... they still warp into my sector filled with fortresses and die... constantlly... not learning at all....   after my previous review I feel sad to say it, but this game is not complete and in all its stuff it lacks some simple details that are far more important. I would now recomend it on sale... seriously though, who has 16 hours straight to stay in a multiplayer game??  what were they thinking ??  final review ././... Meh			"

I've never really been a big strategy game fan. RTS was never my thing, and Grand Strategy seemed way too intimidating to get into. However, spacehips are rad, so I figured I'd give the game a shot. I never expected the game to get its hooks in me like it has.

It is very fun at first in the exporation phase, but when your empire gets bigger the problems start to appear. The AI factions are super passive and only sit on itheir planets and wait. for like 30 hours I've been decleared war on one time. This is a contrast to EU when wars frequently errupted and borders shifted. Things happened in that game.
There are bugs wich makes certain factions impossible to kill unless u use console to trigger events wich should have occured. The thing that bothered me the most though was how hard it was to overview and Macro your empire.  For example a missing intuative EU feature such as a build tab. If I want to build solar panels on my space stations, I have to go into every individual planet and press a button. This is annoying when you have over a 100 hundred planets. same when building starships, you have to go through every planet where u want to build them and press individually. To even access your  planets you have to enter the ""empire"" meny first, then press a specific planet, then go back and forth  in an unresponsive and tiring way. Some kind of ""next planet"" button would help alot. 
When colonizing u first have to find one of ur planets containg the right race adapted for that climate (by scrolling through them all, build them a colony ship, go back to the planet u want to colonize then press coloinze and select the ship you built (there is no other simple way of finding that ship again), then finally press colonize. God! why cant i do all that in just one click at the colonizeable planet!? it's just so much micro.
Also peace negotiation lacks many feutures from EU, such as forcing empires to leave alliances, giving up vassals, making factions leave the war alone and leave their allies and you can never demand more than your specific war goal, wich was very limiting form the beginning. I can go on for pages on things that annoy me, that makes the game a repetitive klick-fest. 
In time I think more features and macro will be updated, but this is very annoying to play. I advise patience.			"
281990,76561197970289053,7,11,0,False,25.7,May 16,"Stellaris makes a great first impression.  The game looks great.  The interface is easy to use.  The font for the text is actually readable (I'm looking at you Distant Worlds).  The early game is very addictive.  The science ship exploration stuff works.  Setting up mining and research stations is a bit simplistic but still diverting.  And the colony management is fairly well done.  
Unfortunately, then the game transitions to the mid game, where is falls flat.  Instead of constant expansion (part of 4""x""), the borders of your empire stagnate as you jut up against one random alien race or another.  Diplomacy bogs down to the old math equation of what your faction is and how much whatever you are offering is worth to the target.  The game displays this in numeric terms which is about as dry as shoe leather.  So you invade to get the ball moving again and are immediately beset with ""war goals"", as though instead of an all powerful space empire who attacks when and where you please you must first sit down and write a note to the other side with the appropriate grievances you have.  
""Dear Adolph, we object to you and demand the liberation of A) France B) Belgium C) Poland...""  and so on.  It's ridiculous.  
Diplomacy is a slog, or worse, a non-event.  Combat itself is simplistic.  No naval tactics.  The various sides fly to point blank range and circle around firing at each other.  Ship design basically boils down to focusing on one of three types of weapon systems (lasers, missiles, or projectiles) and how many shields or armor you can power into your ships.  No boarding.  No fighters.  No individual ship experience.  
Which is kind of a shame.  Because it looks great and for the first few hours you'll be having a blast.  The leader leveling system is kind of neat.  Some of the science events that pop up are cool.  Sadly, this all goes by the wayside further in and you are left staring at various colored blobs on the map wondering if you maybe colonize a planet before your rival.  
The game has potential, but ultimately falls well short of what I believe is the best 4x game available now, Distant Worlds Universe.  That game has a civilian economy that is fairly complex and outside the player's direct control.  Pirates that make more than a guest appearance in one battle early on in the game.  And frankly, the ability to attack who you damn well want to and go where you damn well want to without having to write a note or have a committee meeting.  Also, that Star Trek mod!  
Stellaris looks good at first.  But much like some strange brew of tea you initially approve of, it has an unpleasant aftertaste.  IGN got it right, don't believe the fan boys.  ""DLC will add espionage and the fun"" is not an argument in favor of the current release.			"
281990,76561198015199289,7,11,0,False,44.0,May 16,"I'll keep this short.  I enjoyed the first few hours of the game tremendously.  That span of time delivers on what was promised... an epic galaxy exploration / empire building experience.
That being said though, I was unable to defeat the galaxy 'event' in my very first game because it bugged out (without spoiling, let's just say there was an overwhelming enemy that wouldn't die and couldn't be removed properly from the map).  The mid-to-late game becomes exceptionally tedious, as the optimal paths to success become very obvious to any 4x or grand strategy fan.  I didn't feel like there was a reason to play it again, as I felt I had seen everything there was to see and figured it out, and this was after not even finishing one full game (due to the aforementioned bug).
The major, MAJOR problem with the game right now, though, is the performance.  They did release a hotfix that handled the early game stutter, but late game, even on a medium-sized map, causes the game to hang repeatedly for several seconds at a time.  It's not graphics lag.  It's something to do with the game not being able to keep up with processing the enormous amounts of data it is dealing with.  Basically, the game ticks (days) start to basically pause for between 10 - 30 seconds.  Fleets stutter step through space.  Battles just randomly puase for extended periods.  It is not a fun experience at that point.
Finally, the 4x / grand strategy components are solid in concept, but they don't feel fully realized or fleshed out.  The AI is extremely passive (I wasn't war deced even once, and I won every war I started swiftly and easily).  It really does feel like an inadequately play-tested shell for the delivery of later DLC (which scares me because the game can't properly process what little is there right now).
It's a great concept that makes a good first impression, but I would suggest staying away from this until the technical issues are resolved and an appropriate level of content are delivered.  Otherwise, you'll be left after 20 or 30 hours thinking ""why did I pay for this?""
I'm really sad, actually, because it IS a fun game.  It's just not a finished game, either technically or with regard to content, in my opinion.			"
281990,76561198059008088,7,11,0,True,188.2,May 25,"I can say to summarise right now, Stellaris earns it value in price.... however it does have things that need to be addressed along with additional issues that have caused some to give it a lower opinion of it. Here I will discuss about the overall view I have on Stellaris.
Let’s start by getting some positives out of the way to not make this look negative, what did Paradox do right with Stellaris?
Ai Randomising of Factions: 
In almost every game I’ve played in Stellaris I’ve always enjoyed the randomness of the Ai with their factions and how chanced creativity with the ethics and governments makes for some crazy combinations in Ai Empires. I like how each idea I've seen feels in ways the same and yet different at the same time. It would make more sense to have this instead of set created ones since that would take hours if not days of thinking and writing up. Plus unlike in other Paradox games you don't have an entire era of history to base on so you have to make do with what you have. Kudos for trying Paradox!
Creating your own Empire: 
With other Paradox games the ability to start out and make your own faction/dynasty/kingdom/Empire at the beginning was only a later feature most of the time, with this it works, sure the features are limited on release and right now I would like a few extra pieces here and there, but to get players into this game, the customisation is easy to work with and fun to create some silly combinations. Heck the customisation system alone helped me with some Sci Fi writing I’m working on with some friends of mine.
Ship Modification: 
Part of my enjoyment from this game was seeing what cool and fancy ship designs I could come up with, with the technology progression it just kept me more interested in getting that latest weapon or powerful item to put onto them. I'm hoping when mods become meatier that we can have ship modifications from sci fi franchises, though this could be limited due to rights and trademarks.
System Discovery and Research projects: 
At First I found doing this to be tedious but over time, discovering stuff from research led to me as a player finding out about some interesting and rare technologies and things. I like how some games promote the idea of unique projects to research like for example finding out about ancient empires long lost and you doing some deep space exploration to find what happened to them or finding a way to prevent a potential extinction of your race. The random generation of galaxies also helps to make different starts sometimes challenging with different allocation of resources and research at your disposal, nothing is set in stone which can lead to repeated playability. 
Mod Support: 
This isn't something new to Paradox, but still good to see that they are continuing with their tradition in having their games supporting the mod systems is something perfect for Stellaris. Since with many sci fi genres out there, it is a very attractive place to include cosmetic and game play like features outside of DLC and patches. This can result in possibly dozens if not hundreds of hours in replayability.
Now we have to move onto Things I don't like about this game in its current state and general concerns, Remember I'm not going to bash a game that's making an effort to try, but I'm also going to constructively criticise some bad choices made by Paradox in making stellaris as well.
The Release with Achievement Bugs and glitches: 
Firstly if you are going to release a game and it has a wide variety of achievements, make sure they are at least obtainable and not have major bugs that stop you from accessing them. Bugs in where you have a leader live to be 400 can be overlooked, but having a bug that stops you accessing a Scourge achievement isn't acceptable. Personally Stellaris should have been postponed at least 2 weeks to really flesh and Iron out the game. I know every game is known to have Bugs and glitches on release; it’s naive to think it won't have any, but obvious ones that should have been checked before release like achievement related ones........that is disappointing. 
A lack of Achievements: 
Personally the amount of achievements we have with this game right I think is surprisingly small, this is  a 4x Strategy game I was expecting to see almost twice as many then the ones we got. Don't get me wrong the achievements they have are creative, I just feel we should have gotten much more on release. That way until they come with DLC's and Patches we still have something to play around with. Since I've gotten at least 3/4's of the achievements with the last not getting around to or unable to because of bugs.  At the end of this review I'm going to post a Paradox forum topic which I made that shows some achievement ideas I came up with along with ideas to improve the game. Feel free to check it out and add some of your own ideas.
A Lack of Crisis's: 
The ideas for the Crisis's that Stellaris has are interesting for them to spawn, the trouble is, there are only 3, I would prefer if those were some of the BIG Crisis events that effects everyone involved with Ai responding to them and not hanging back like chickens or lemmings. What they could have included was internal crisis's too, for example civil wars where like 1/3 to 1/2 +  of your worlds even worlds in sectors break away and could result in your empire tearing itself apart. Or maybe a power in a desperate bid to over throws your current government. There needs to be more of a focus on things like these so the gradual progression in the game doesn't dull down.
So for now I honestly don’t have much to say since from hearing back from Paradox’s recent Clark patch they seem to be fixing some of the Ai problems in not seeing as a threat along with other UI features and stuff. However I shall leave this link here
https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/stellaris-patch-and-dlc-suggestions.937072/
This as I have stated before in this review is a topic I created for users to add some Suggestions for Paradox to work with Stellaris.
For now Stellaris to me is a Game that I’ll be honest I’m biased towards, it has its problems, the Ai is buggy, there are glitches in the game and some features feel like they need to be added. This could have been intentional for DlC. But despite all of that, I’ve enjoyed this game, it has already earned its value back from me in the amount of hour’s I’ve played it, multiplayer has been fun with friends of mine, And I do like the features paradox shows for Federations and Alliances, but they need to be expanded upon.
So my Verdict is for Stellaris “Worth looking into, but wait for at least a few patches before getting into playing.”
In fairness when Eu4 first came out, it had problems and over time it was patched and had a tonne of DLC added for better or worse and I’ve enjoyed that game myself a lot.			"
281990,76561198007308399,8,13,0,True,52.4,May 25,"Sooo, Stellaris finally. Greatly hyped, greatly anticipated, greatly dissapointing in the end for some. Is it perfect? No. Can you kill an whole species, enslave humanity and essentially make them pets? Yes. So, easily best game of 2016 10/10
But yeah, seriously. The game fundamentally works, is fun and has an good early game. BUT. It stumbles hard in the midgame, doesnÂ´t really get up in the mid-late game, and falls even harder in the very late game. Bad diplomacy, currently unbalanced combat, and an meh AI (note that i wrote this before the Clarke update went out, so the last two things will get fixed soon).
So, why do i still recommend it? Because it is fun. And because PDS developed it. It might not be perfect now, but infiltrating an primitive species to make them slaves just never stops being great. And it will only get better.			"

Even the portraits are so bland in comparison. I hate seeing my species's single portrait recolored and reused over and over for my scientists, leaders, etc. 
It feels like I would have to play online for there to be any worthwhile co-op game play. The AI seems to just want to do their own thing. And even if they are friendly there isn't much they can do for the player.
I'm sure like all the other Paradox games there will be plenty of more to come. I will revise my review and take Stellaris off the shelf at later date... At this very moment I've spent more time browsing the workshop trying to find mods to make this game fun than in the actual game...

281990,naconic,9,15,0,True,50.0,May 15,"Having played this game like a second job since release, I can recommend Stellaris as a flawed but great space 4x/Grand Strategy game. The premise of the game revolves around building an empire within a single galaxy (of between 100-1000 stars.) One wins by controlling 40% of colonizable worlds (there are a lot) or subjugating every other empire on the board. The game can be broken down into early, middle, and late game portions, and I'll review the game across those parts.
Pre-Game:
+You have the opportunity to build a custom race from scratch - do it! The deep level of race creation will define who your empire is, what their ethos are, and what their government is. This will dictate much of how the game plays for you once you start the game. Great customization and depth.
Early-Game:
+The Early Game exploration is fantastic. It's simply the best example in the genre of a small empire starting out and everything being mysterious/threatening/interesting. The event chains, especially in the early game, add a huge amount of flavor and vibrancy to the universe; there are some event chains that will only appear in a given galaxy, so you won't see every possibility in a single game.
+Planet management is solid; you will balance food/minerals/energy/research on your first planets carefully to optimize the path that your empire is taking. There are meaningful choices on the tiles that you will manage (whether to enhance them or bulldoze them), along with some basic base-placement mechanics.
+Your empire is run by individuals at this point; the leaders of your empire are its governors, scientists, admirals, and generals. Choosing the right individual for the job is well-done, and you do get to know certain admirals or governors as their stories progress.
+Ship design is meaningful and there are at least a few choices you'll need to pursue; the weaponry breaks down into energy/mass drivers/missiles early on, and the distinction does matter against the various types of defenses in the game (shields/armor, and there balance thereof.)
Mid-Game:
+Sectors are a feature that you are required to use as your empire grows; you have a core segment of planets that you are allowed to manage, while you will need to create independent administrative sectors to manage your planets in excess of the limit.
-Finding the right balance with sectors can be difficult, and unintuitive; you'll often face factions wanting independence for their sectors.
+Sectors reduce the amount of micromanagement that you have to do for a given set of planets; you can assign priorities, and a few constraints, and generally your sectors will execute on this reasonably well; your sectors can be lead by a governor who confers benefits or penalties to his administrative zone based on his traits.
+/- Population management becomes more complex at this point; you may have multiple species in your empire, with different ethos and ideas and preferences. If you like the detail of assigning the correct populations to the correct tasks on your planets, this is pretty enjoyable. For many, it's an opaque exercise in micro-managing.
+/- At this point in the game you've likely met all the surrounding empires, and have probably found a few that will just dislike you no matter what.
+The ways in which you can interact with unfriendly empires are fairly interesting; you can conquer them and try to assimilate their populations, or you can ""liberate"" their worlds to force their newly formed government to adopt your ethos and outlook.
+Warfare is the most interesting at this stage in the game; managing your fleets to create the right fighting force to face down threats makes all the difference; a 1k-strong fleet can easily beat a 2k-strong fleet if it's built to counter the stronger fleet.
+The research system shines at this point in the game, as well; you generally select techs based on a 'card' system - you have 3+ techs to choose to research in three different areas.
Late-Game:
+Generally, alliances have formed and Federations (cooperative governments) have assembled at this point in the game. You as a player have formed a federation or are a member of an alliance, and will be facing off similiarly-sized groups of alien nations.
-The nuance of combat breaks down, somewhat, at this point; blobbing large fleets tends to be more important than composition (though it can still matter.)
-The path to victory is something of a slog a this point; that's not to say that it's not still interesting, but you'll find yourself doing many of the same things for decades on end.
+Late game technologies offer interesting, 'dangerous' choices - research that represents a fundamental societal shift that could threaten your empire.
+Late game crises occur at this point in the game; these are large existential threats to the galaxy as a whole, that generally require a huge amount of resources to defeat. While these threats are different in flavor, they are mechanically similar.
Other Notes:
+The soundtrack is amazing; think Interstellar and Star Wars.
+The graphics are good. Most objects are done with good detail, the animated portraits for races are great.
+There is a significant amount of replayability in this game.
+There is even more replayability through mods, which are out in droves at this point.
Things I want to See:
-Right now, Corvettes are just... overpowered. Defensively-built evasion fleets with some point defence just win. Destroyers and Cruisers need a buff.
-Fire control on one's fleets leaves a lot to be desired; if I have 5 battleships, they'll focus fire a single corvette when they could kill 1 corvette each with their available weaponry in a single volley.
Summary:
I recommend this game, though there are points that become tedious or unfun at times. This is one of the best representations of a 4x/Grand strategy in space that I've ever played, even with its flaws.			"
281990,Thadwookie,9,15,0,True,164.3,May 22,"This game will keep you glued so much that you might miss work, watchout.. I have yet to get to end game. It took a few remakes to understand the best way to do things, or what to build for, or what the capabilitys and how the planet cap system works. All in all game is amazing. If you like Civ 5, but felt it needed a bit more to maintain, this is the game is for you!			"
281990,76561198060916579,9,15,0,False,31.9,July 2,"Unlike other games in this genre, Paradox has created an inflexible game that as you progress increasingly becomes more and more boring due to limitations they built into the game on purpose.  What limitations?  (1) The larger you get the more your tech advances cost, and if you get ahead tech wise your tech costs go up again.  This effectively keeps most players within a narrow band tech wise, as Paradox hated the whole idea of people trying to race up tech trees to gain advantages.  You can't do that here.  (2) The game always has to be played with some type of advanced tech alien in the game (fallen empires).  And these empires have ships so in advance of you that you have no hope of beating them until very late in a game.  Plus if you settle to close to them they get upset and attack, forcing you to destroy the settlement + one or two other worlds as punishment.  SO while you can't race up the tree, you have an enemy you have to avoid in order to survive.  (3) Limited world control.  Oh so sorry, you can only directly control 5 (or a few more with tech advances) worlds at a time.  The rest have to be assigned to sectors and controlled by the (dumb AI) computer.  And just to force you to keep to that mechanic, it will cost you precious admin points to remove a world from a sector (so no moveing worlds in and unless you cheat and give yourself admin to make up for this stupidity).  (4) No way to break up alien alliances.  Once they form they are more solid than diamonds.  All you can do is get in your own alliance and both sides can stare at each other daring one to cross the border.  Hence mid game and later becomes massive wars where you are depending on your computer allies for any success .. and if they screw up, you are so screwed.  (5) Late Game boredom.  And this is the reason you see so few games of Stellaris being posted on the net .. people have quickly tired of the game.  If you want to win a domination victory, you usually have to go to war alliance to alliance, and target only a few planets each war.  If you try for more, since they can jump around in space, you usually end up in a trading game of you taking planets while their fleets take your planets and neither side advances war wise.  So the game bogs down into go to war, take a couple planets, end war, get planets out of resistance, go to war again .. over and over and over while you try to advance on the domination victory mark.  
I could keep going on and on with all the issues and errors in this game.  it's one of the worst I've purchased and I'd return it for a refund if I could.			"

However, all things considered, the Ankle deep diplomacy, the imbalanced poorly executed  civilization management system, the one sided incredibly overpowered AI, all that Stellaris boils down to is a paper thin pretty picture. The exploration is fantastic, but it ends there. as soon as you have the misfortune of encountering another intelligent society, kiss your pretty little empire good-bye.
All AI races within the game follow no logical pattern. They will declare war on you at the drop of a hat no matter your current relationship with them while roundly rejecting every single attempt you may make at interaction. Would you like to form an alliance? +180 opinion towards you? NOPE, rejected. Trade technology for the greater good of us both? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Can we at least trade minerals? NO, UNACCEPTABLE! Then you get invaded by an empire with a 2 planet economy matching you 1:1 for production power. 
My breaking point was spending over 100 years as a technological isolationist, I was CONSTANTLY under attack by everyone and their dog. Never took land (because that is a negative influence bonus) just defended myself like the nerd in high school. Finally manage to get 4 neighboring powers to over 200+ opinion of me, and you know what they did? Allied to the bug people to my flank who have attacked THEM before and then, even with the fact that alliances must VOTE for a war, they raise their guns and JOIN FORCES against me.
Avoid this game at all costs, it's all show and zero real initiative or effort. Do what I didn't and save your money for a game that has earned it.

281990,76561197968014181,10,17,0,False,52.0,May 25,"Wow, this is going to be hard for me. First I am a huge fan of Paradox games. I've been playing them since the first EU came out. I have just about every addon for EU4 and CK2 and still enjoy playing those games. So when I saw Stellaris I jumped at the opportunity to try the first new Paradox franchise in years.
Unfortunetly, the game is just plain borring. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of potential but the game just seems unfinished. First, despite having a computer well above the recommended specs, late game just drags to the point of being unplayable. Then there is the AI, which doesn't seem to ever do anything. Even when the AI is far superior then I am, they will never attack or do anything to interact with my empire. 
The biggest let down is the end game. After surveying half the galaxy the game just becomes a micro-managing nightmare. Don't get me wrong, Paradox games are known for their high levels of detail, but this is different. There are never internal conflicts or special events in late game. You just spend you time upgrading power plants and mines every time you tech up. Eventually you dwarf the other nearby empires and spend most of the game chasing down their fleets who refuse to engage.
I feel like this game is waiting for some big patch to make it fun. I know Paradox is big on patching their games and usually does a great job of making content worthwhile. However, this is the first game from them that has left me feeling let down. I want this game to be good, but it just isn't.			"

Corvettes are way too OP with their high dodge (please nerf).
Just lack of content in general, no trading, no war tactics or chokepoints being used by AI, fortressses need to be buffed and are way to weak to defend anything let alone hold off a huge fleet.

There are some thing Stellaris is doing well, such as such as intesting ethic and government system, some interesting races and technologies,  decent ship designer and a few of the events are fun. However, there are issues with the execution of some mechanics that other reviewers have already talked about. 
  In addition, I love big space games have one continous map are at most a few sections (e.g., Endless Space, Gal. Civ 3, etc.). However, in Stellaris, the exploration, scientist planet mapping and having a construction unit build mines, etc. 150-1000 many times turns Steallaris into a boring experience.  These miniature chunks of space in all seem identical and give nothin of the feel of being in outer space like other games of the same genre, which have beter map visuals on single map of the same or larger size than the entirety of Stellaris overall map.  
  Also, having to repeat the cycle for 150-1000 minimaps for each of these individually gets extremely tedious.  I know all grand stategies such as Paradox's (own them all) have that to some level to add depth and realism, but the game as it is I now I cannot reommend it.			"

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I just can't get closer than -40 acceptance of letting me join. So when 2 different alliances delcare war on my only vassal, I can't do anything.
I mean it seems like for me to be able to join, the alliens have to have the same traits/opinions that I do. Yet for the others, it almost doesn't matter. Except for an alliance that was formed by 5 piece loving empires, which was a cool touch. It's almost impossible to get a good trade deal, unless the other empire suggest it. I mean I just want civilian access but I just can never get it.
My sectors are stupid on how they build a planet, I'd rather manage everything myself. I can't seem to be able to build up enough influence to intergrate my vassal, so I don't get anything from them. They can't do anything without me either.
There are no trade lines, so I can't trade anything from planet to planet to help if I'm missing something (ie food) which sucks. If there were trade lines, I could also go after them with my fleets, which would help when I'm weaker.

I've played other Space 4X and they never hit the mark Master of Orion 2 did.  Galatic Civililzation was deep, but never held my interest.  If you have never played a Paradox game before, know that this one uses the best of hte last 3 games released. Concepts from Europa Unversalis IV and Crusader Kings 2 are woven into this 4X and it works.  Multiplayer works fantastic, and it is all i've played.

281990,JohnNavarro,13,23,0,True,31.0,May 27,"Stellaris is a beautiful 4X strategy game set in space. From the graphics to the soundtrack, it's artistically superb. When I first launched the game, I found myself staring at the scenery and units in amazement just as I did with Witcher 3. The detail that went into the games presentation is astounding. Once you overcome your wonder and delight enough to actually start playing, you truly feel as though you're at the helm of a fledgling interstellar empire taking its first steps into space. You're excited, and you're curious. If you're like me when you set up your first game, you'll make sure to choose humanity as your race, and purposely pay no attention to the appearances or descriptions of any other: you'll want to be surprised. As your first survey ship leaves your home system, you'll wonder what awaits it. You know you're not alone, but where are they, and what're they like? The immense depth you've already seen so far has inspired the highest expectations in you. You know only that they'll be interesting and unique. Suffice to say, you won't soon find yourself disappointed, but I won't spoil it for you.
As the game progresses, you might find that Stellaris isn't a game without problems. The signature Paradox Warscore system throttles progress through conquest, leaving the game's pace best suited for only the very most patient gamer. Luckily a few campaigns and a handful of conquered systems later, you'll find more efficient strategies for handling warscore, and the pace will seem more reasonable. There's three beginning methods of propulsion to choose from in the game, such as warp, and those other methods can be frustrating to counter. Your adversary may bypass your border defenses entirely and appear instantaneously at the center of your empire, where it could theoretically raid you with impunity, attacking your stations then moving onto the next system before your warp ships had the chance to respond to the first. This isn't a circumstance in which there's no answer, but it can and will be frustrating, especially at first. Once you do catch up with the attacking fleet, its likely to simply retreat rather than allow you to destroy it. Makes sense, but it also makes annoying. You're gonna be chasing fleets of raiders around the galaxy before you know it: They attack, you intercept, they retreat, they attack, you intercept, they retreat, ad infinitum, or so it might sometimes seem.
Is Stellaris worth it? Yes, absolutely, beyond any doubt. Will the mechanics designed to artificially lengthen and otherwise forcefully shape the game frustrate you at times? Yes, absolutely, beyond any doubt. Buy Stellaris now, and envelop yourself with the beauty and elegance, the depth and wonder, the mundane and vexation. Be amazed. Be annoyed.

+ Massive galaxy
+ Good race creation
+ Multiple FTL technologies
+ Side mission 
+ Randomised Tech choices
-----------------------------
- Poor late game
- Passive game play (even with large control of planets)
- Only 4 class assult ships
- Poor diplomecy choices
- Conquered races takes time to integrate  (+- 10 - 1000 months which is 5 min to 2 hours at max game speed)
Stellaries is a fun game with a high diverse of races to pick and create yourself, interesting side missions and side tech to collect but playing only for a few hours the game tends to slow down after all races have establisted their borders and spaces betweem each other the game then goes on a marathon of alliences and federations (which is cool). A massive scaled game with a randomised tech makes each game plays differently and  interesting, but it laks a massive tech tree to keep the game going, once reaching mid late game (I found myselft only giving +%% to already tech) which is boring. 
Turning to warfare the game has a pretty cool system placed in tirms of conquer and being conquered. Conquering other planets and space is done by warpoints and only then you can integrate the conquered race into your empire (which takes time to get that option plus more time for the procces to do so) the bigger the race the longer it takes.
I feel that stellaries would of been a game of the year if they had brought in same experist to advise them on different techs, biology, planets and so forth. As I can see same of the technologies is pretty standerd and nothing really speciel. MMO 2 still have some unique species traits I've seen so far and a pretty high weapon base tech. over here is it just Kinetic. Missles and Lasers ( Level I, II, III, IV, V, VI)			"

I am a paradox fan - EUIV HOIIII for several hundred hours so I dont shy from a challenge. 
Im glad this is a huge commercial success for Paradox, so they should be able to put things right. 
I have found a number of flaws - things I dont  like as have we all. Aprt from that I am in awe of the scope of the game, and like many of us have given Paradox too much of a pass till now. 
The Game breaker for me is Influence, it is used to buy leaders, outposts, etc and not initially mentioned - tier two planet improvements.  In my current game it has a myriad of uses and I am currently getting 1 stinking point a month, and outpost costs 100 points
I hope I am wrong about this but I dont think so. 
It seems to me a solution would be to remove inflence costs for at least some things
This isnt the first time Paradox have done something like this - HOIIII has a very complex logistics system that seems to be a complete clusterf*ck. The only way I can manage it is the sandox mode that disables logistics. 
Maybe a mod can do something for stellaris  
Maybe Im just stupid I wonder though how all the people writing the glowing reviews have not noticed this. 
I was going to preorder HOIIV when it comes avail - Once bitten twice shy. 
I give Stellaris another try when I hear of some serious changes

281990,thefatbastid,17,31,0,False,48.7,May 15,"I'm sure it will eveuntally get patched and a great game will get added to the great foundation but right now I can't recommend what it currently is.
Things that need fixing:
1) Lists of habitable planets instead of scouring the actual map (which can get very cluttered)
2) Map modes. needs at least a diplo map mode so i know who i'm at war with/ vassal status.
3) Centralized diplo options. The 'empire' list is not useful and murky. Want to move an embassy? ugh.
4) The system view is mostly useless but is the default view (note how galaxy view has the close view button). With a few context menus you wouldn't need it at all.
5) Automation of the system surveying and construction. While the sectors can handle it, you can't give them ships and having them build ships leads to odd results of ownership (may be a bug)
6) The help button is just a link to the wiki. Instead of a manual or in-game info (like the civpedia in civ) it links to an external website that is already out of date and incomplete, like all the other paradox wikis.
7) In general, weak feedback to the player to understand what is going on in terms of warfare
8) Can't see what pop is on a colony ship
9) all the fun and interesting events stop mid game and things get boring.
Things I'd like to see:
1) zooming into and out of system view with the scroll wheel.
Game play problems:
1) Weak diplomacy and trading with other empires
2) Weak internal management. I think i had 2 or 3 factions ever. Since I had maxed resources it was easy to just click a few buttons to make them go away forever. Planets never ask for anything.
3) Not sure what the AI does during a war but it doesn't seem to do anything useful. Unless warping between 2 sectors over and over is useful.

281990,narnach,2,2,0,True,39.3,May 9,"The most approachable of Paradox' games so far. It has a very useful in-game tutorial, clear interface.
It has all the ingredients you would expect from a 4X strategy game: custom race creation, huge galaxies, lots of opponents, eXploration, eXpansion, eXploitation and eXtermination. Once you start bumping in to lots of opponents, it starts to show its Paradox colors, using the racial traits to setup basic diplomatic relations and then letting you establish rivalries or embassies to influence the relation further.
This is a slow steam locomotive in terms of game pace: don't expect to get into proper warfare until you are a few hours in. You need all your early game resources to expand your economy, then expand by getting more colonies and protect them with a larger navy. The neutral creatures that roam the world provide interesting targets to shoot at, and the dozens of random events keep you busy while you slowly build your empire.
If you are new to 4X games or to Paradox games, this might be a good gateway drug for you.

It has all the intricate elements that I've been looking for in a space 4x game, and the real time pause/play feature seems much better than turn based games like this! The races are sooo extensive and unique, custom build one to see for yourself! I made my first race and I am loving it thus far. Please, check out this game if you haven't already. I am absolutely loving it! I will keep my review up to date as I continue playing. I should also not that I play lots of games like this: gal civ 3, sid meier's civ 5, total war games etc. This one is different... 
Stellaris features multiple things that set it apart from its competitors:
1) Pause/play global action. All fights, events, exploration... everything in the game is real time pause/play! (no turns)
2) Unique research method of generating 3 options at a time (no tree).
3) Control not just one leader, but multiple leaders that serve under your main one(s).
4) Expand planetary building functionality as your population steadily expands across the planets.
5) The MOST EXTENSIVE character/faction creation system in this kind of game yet.
6) Unique art style, featuring ANIMATED 2-D character icons that work extremely well for the variety of races.
7) SOOOOOO many races! (With more surely to follow)
8) Unique planet types with habitation possible even in extreme conditions.
9) Unique alert system that compliments the pause/play global function well.
10) Extensive star systems and unique means of traveling between said systems.
11) Events that make mention of YOUR unique empire name (event mission chains of sorts).
12) Speed up and slow down time globally as you please. Want that research done now? High speed baby!!!
I am certain that there are more amazing things that I am either forgetting at the moment or have yet to encounter, but I am loving this game thus far. It is worth every penny that I spent on it, and I got the most expensive version! I can't wait to see what they have in store for the future DLC and steam workshop content that modders will add! I am also looking forward to checking out the art book and novel that were included with my purchase.
Verdict: 10/10 (will continue updating)
p.s. My only complaint isn't even really a valid complaint. I ordered the most expensive edition (forget what it was called) and was kindof hoping to receive physical copies of the novel, signed poster and perhaps the artbook. All of it was digital though.

+ Excellent race customization and new game setup options
+ Exploration ""quests"" in the early game provide interesting and enjoyable diversions to keep you entertained while you wait for colonies to grow and things to be built.
+ Incredible depth combined with a very decent user-friendly presentation.
+ Presents a level of polish that exceeds humbled expectations.
- Some gameplay concepts are not as easily presented as they could be. (e.g. It's not clear at first glance that placing a building on a tile on a planet surface will replace certain yields depending on the type of building until after you commit to clicking the ""Build"" button at which point the game tells you that building this building will replace the following yields). You're given the option to confirm, but a better means of communicating what the final yields would be for a tile given a certain building before clicking the Build button would be most welcome.
- Cannot queue up ships or constructions to be built if you lack the resources to build them right now. This forces you to remember to build the thing you want to build later once the necessary resources are available. For instance, if you only have 50 minerals, you can't queue up a fleet of ships and have them be built as the resources come in; instead you must tend to the shipyard and build new ships as your resources come in manually.
Verdict: Must Buy
Any shortcomings or minor nuances that may bug you about this game will most likely be addressed in later patches given the developer's track record. In the game's current state you will still be rewarded with hours of enjoyment until then. And after the patches and DLCs come out, you'll get even more.

After that bold experiment comes the endless iterative development - new takes on the old recipe - that tend to be defined more by how they differ from the original genre establishing title than any way else.
For the 4X game in space it has always been Master of Orion. Since it's release there have been many attempts to take the crown and yet we tend to compare all newcomers to MOO when we consider the key question ""Is this alright, then, or what?""
After almost 15 hours of gameplay I can now say, confidently, that I have a new gold standard for 4x space games. Stellaris. When even a faithful rerelease of the venerable Master of Orion left me wanting a little something more, Stellaris has delivered all of my ""It needs to be...""s and all of my ""It would be nice if...""s and come up with a few touches beyond.

Long known as the father studio of Grand Strategy, the numerous systems and mechanics at work in those games often made one think of how they would work outside of historical fiction. Now, we finally know, and the result is an experience that is incredible in both form and function.
It must have taken a lot of courage for Paradox to try their hand at a 4x game as it's not the genre they know best. It's clear that they had to leave their comfort zone to make this game, but they did so with a level of elegance and grace that speaks volumes to their skill and dedication to making damn good games.  Stellaris is just that, a damn good game. 
The artwork of Stellaris pays tribute to longstanding Sci-fi behemoths such as Eve and Endless Space. It is clean, yet abstract just like space itself. Playing gives one a sense of whimsical fantasy laced with the Austere beauty of precision you'd expect from an exacting and scientific game. The result is artwork that is both beautiful enough to be admired, yet  clean enough to prevent sensory overload. Stellaris is simply beautiful to behold.
As for music, there's hardly a moment where the pacing doesn't fit perfectly with what happens in game. One would think this is entirely the kind of music you'd play if you were on a ship, in interstellar space. It's a cross between modern sophistication and classical sensibility. Clearly, the art and music team worked very closely, and the results show.
Gameplay is the heart of any game, and it's something Paradox has long been masterful at delivering. Here, they took bold steps to try their hand at systems they don't have much experience with while blending them with those that they do. In the end, the combination of these systems proves to be more of a match made in heaven than anybody could have predicted. There are some flaws, rough edges, and missing pieces, but as a 1.0 game, the foundation is hands down the best Paradox, and the genre have yet put out. Given Paradox's track record, within one year this game will have more features than the next two 4x games combined. Already, it proves to be a perfect blend of two similar, yet distinct genres.
For those unfamiliar, you will play in real time managing a fledgling empire. You can colonize planets and configure them for specific types of production. You can build fleets of ships and wage wars, or you can diplomatically isolate enemies while strengthening alliances. Hire leaders to manage your affairs from afar, and explore the frontiers of the galaxy to uncover secrets, technology and unfathomable dangers. For the first time in a 4x game, exploration is both fun and integral. The blending of strategy and RPG like elements means you will feel completely immersed in the lore of the galaxy. 
I simply can't speak highly enough about this game. As is, it is perfectly playable and utterly refreshing. As a longtime Paradox fan, I am more excited about the future of this game than I was about its release. There is no doubt in my mind that this will be the definitive space game if it isn't already. Please buy to show your support for Paradox. They aim to do one thing: Make damn good games.			"

More to say that it doesn't hold your hand beyond explaining what the menus do and drops you to figure out what you need to do with your empire.
I am two hours into my first playthrough starting with the tutorial. I feel elated to be taking humanity to the stars but there is so much adversity that every challenge however minor feels like triumph.
I will admit that I have not explored this game fully so I can't give it a full score but I would at the very least label this game a 8/10 if not 9/10 with opinions pending.
Subjectively though, 10/10 because I got to swarm a pathetic pirate outpost with three fleets.			"
281990,nixxnikoli,2,2,0,True,190.6,May 20,"4X meets Grand Strategy in a very well presented package, with great gameplay, interesting scripted events and a simply amazing soundtrack that doesn't get old.
Gameplay: 9/10 - Fleet formations are the only thing missing right now
Graphics: 8/10 - Some optimisation issues in very large fleet battles & slightly muddy texture quality on maximum zoom in
Sound: 10/10 - Amazing work, the UI, soundtrack, battle sounds, everything. Outstanding job with audio design
Multiplayer: 10/10 - No issues with desync, even connection issues and packet loss between players simply pause the game till the affected player catches up. Playing 2 player co-op? You can spawn right next door to your friend. Brilliant
Overall: 9.5/10 - An excellent game right now, that will only get better because of the Dev's approach to game support, improvement, free feature updates and cosmetic DLCs. Broke or don't want DLC and worried about multiplayer? If the host has the DLC, everyone in the game has it.

281990,illuzian,2,2,0,True,74.7,May 16,"I definitely recommend Stellaris. The setting is fantastic and it is hugely enjoyable, it offers enough depth and customisation to get you truly hooked.
There are some things you need to know though:
-If you're playing a large game, there's a significant amount of lag end game making it near unplayable. I believe they are working on a fix for this.
-Mid game is sorely lacking.
-You can cheese the game currently with vassals.
-Diplomacy is lacking.
-There are only 2 victory conditions: Conquest - Conquer or vassalise all factions, Domination - hold 40% of habitable planets.
-Research is RNG, this is good and bad.
-You can't realistically play a small empire and be able to comete with bigger ones. You have a higher chance of forming alliances but the beneifits of expanding are much greater.
-Fallen empires can massively disrupt your progression.
Sure the list is fairly large but the nice things Stellaris does outweigh them and Paradox will definitely work on some of them and improving the game overall. This ranks as one of the best space strategy games of all time for me.			"

That being said, I've played almost nothing else since it was released, and it's smashed all sale records for Paradox, which is usually used to niche titles released for niche audiences.
On the one hand I wish I had seen the game with the fixes and extra features they are adding over the next few months, on the other hand I'd have been severely annoyed if this game was delayed, so they can't win.

I do have some... issues... with the terreforming system, and which planets are habitable vs not, but overall, Stellaris is stunningly beautiful, extremely well-crafted, and definitely gives you that ""Just...

The ship designer is great fun, and actually allows you to focus ships on different combat roles, such as carrier operations, defense, assault, support, etc; the management system is complex, but not overly so, and the gameplay is absolutely top-notch.

The amount of detail present in past games made learning them a slow hours long process but also reflected a lot of work and very serious amountsof substance. This is no different in Stellaris except that you're not spending half your day learning. Every aspect I could have asked for seems to be present so far. Want to genetically modify a steam-age civilization of newly discovered humans? You can. Want exploration and colonization? There's tons. Want to be a fanatically individualist race of fungus people? Of course. Want to edit your own ships? Why not. Orbital bombardment and planetary assaults? You got it, and with amazing graphics too. LORE?! Plenty. It feels to me like they looked at every other sci fi game to see what people wished they had gotten from them, made a list of all those things and put them in a grand strat. So far war seems less frequent but feels much more intense than in previous Paradox games, what I would expect from war between different planets.

The start is exciting, exploring the unknown, but the sense of exploration gets lost once you have several AI empires discovered near you and space starts to get a little boring. It also seems the AI still needs plenty of work with wars and sectors.
On the plus side, this game has plenty of modding potential and the music is great. There is no research tree, instead there is a more interesting and rewarding feel of gaining technology.			"
281990,76561198013528594,2,2,0,True,39.4,May 12,"Alright, so I bought this game when it became available for Pre-purchase and this is my ""first"" review of a game. 
After a 24 hours of total playtime, I can tell these:
-Gameplay will slow down and sometimes game starts to lag when lots of things happen.
(However I believe that Paradox will fix this problem with patches.)
-Time-consuming. I mean, literally, last night I wasn't able to sleep at all! ""One more research, one more battle!"" 
-No ""micromanagemant"" for battles. You can equip your ships with aggressive or defensive computer chips and that's that. You can't order a certain ship to attack another ship. They're all automated.
-Planets/Moons become repetitive. After a lot of surveying, you realize that the planets look like each other a lot. 
(Someone made a video review for this game said they could use some kind of ""random planet generator"".) 
+Satisfying visuals. They actually done a great job with the stars, blackholes and etc.
+Also satisfying micromanagement of your empire. If you have played Civilizations before, you'll get used to it in no time.
+Sleek/Simple UI. If you prefer, your robot guide will notify and give you info every time something happens. Very good for learning the basics. 
+HUGE map. I mean, literally, it so HUGE that you can't keep an eye on everything. LOTS of Empires, LOTS of stuff going on. 
+Primitive/Superior Civs. You invent FTL and go to space bla bla... When you do that, you may get b*tchslapped right in your face by another empire that was in space WAY LONGER than you do.  Also, you may b*tchslap another civs which may be in Industrial Age, or maybe Bronz Age even. 
+Detailed race/perks creating. Really, it gives you a lot of options to create your own race. 
+Very easy and accessible gameplay. What I mean is, you can select a constructor/science ship and order them around by right clicking the ststem/planet/moon etc. Right click, opens up a menu. ""I was like-wuuuuuut"".  Mouse hover info and simple screens make it easier to make ""strategies"". 
+OST's are really AMAZING. I really care about sounds in a game and Stellaris doesn't disappoint me with that. ""Thank youuu""
CONCLUSION: You should buy this game. There are a lot of rooms for modding&DLC's so I guess Paradox will provide gameplay improvements with patches&expansions.

281990,76561197989273094,2,2,0,True,60.5,May 22,"Stellaris is a nice, current, addition to the 4x sci-fi family of games. Stellaris is NOT Master of Orion (in any iteration) and I find significant differences in the degree of necessary micromanagement and diplomacy. The tech system is simple and clean, though, without an in game ""visible"" tree, what you research and when is left open to ""chance/insipriation"" rather than by focus. The odds of going down a given tech chain do increase with more techs in said chain, but, when new, knowing what chains are actually there is very much a ""black box"" (without looking at game files).
Diplomacy, thus far, is superior to many sandbox/4x games I have played todate. The AI, when operating on it's own, remains above average, both in their interactions with the player and between AI to AI. AI operations become more ""questionable"" in either an alliance or a federation--where their ability for independent action seems to have been labotimised.
Stellaris is highly modable and has scores of options for alteration. This allows for a nearly infinite replayability.
My greatest complaint with Stellaris is the fragile quest chains currently present. Though the quests/missions are well written, several of the longer chains can be very readily broken, and thus the quest being incompletable. This, I hope, will be addressed in future patches.
I have found multiplayer to be enjoyable, however, the speed of the game and the time required to complete a full game, currently makes pick-up games of Stellaris impossible. That is to say, unless you have a regular group for regular gaming sessions, you will NEVER finish a multi-player game of Stellaris. This, I find, is unfortunate. The scale of Stellaris is one of it's major selling points, but that same scale makes pick-up multiplayer matches untenable.
Thus far I highly recommend this title. We shall see what future patches and DLC afford.			"

Everybody said Endless Legend was better than Endless Space, so I went with that. People said Civ BE was a poor man's Civ5... in space, so I skipped it. I bought Space Empires V, but just couldn't get into it. Sins of a Solar Empire is the only I can think of that I've really put any time into. Then along comes Stellaris...
Like space themed 4x games, grand strategy is another genre I long felt I should be in love with, yet for years every attempt I made to tackle the genre was an effort in futility until I came across Crusader Kings II. Paradox knows how to make a map and spreadsheets immerse you in another universe like nobody else. 
Stellaris is Paradox's first escape from real, Earthly history, as well as their first 4x game. It has the best tutorial of any Paradox game thus far, and since it's a 4x and everyone starts out small, it lets you take baby steps into the more complicated aspects of grand strategy. 
I begun my journey as a fungoid race of fanatic spiritualist collectivists run by divine mandate. In other words, they're a new age mushroom cult dedicated to enslaving everyone through psychedelic mind control. I only have 3 races of slaves, though. All neolithic primitives discovered on planets I colonized. I decided that I would expand peacefully for as long as possible, and as of writing this review I'm finally surrounded on all sides with no colonizable planets left to conquer save one right on the border of a fallen empire, which means I'd be in big trouble if I tried to take it.
This early game phase has been phenomenal. Despite not waging a single war or forming a single alliance, I have a vast empire with multiple uplifted and integrated species. Of the 3 I integrated without enslaving, 1 I even managed to genetically modify into happy and obedient worker bees. Who needs slavery when they WANT to be your peasant? Unfortunately our experimentation with genetics has also led a sect of my own people to modify themselves into a master race that are beginning to raise a stir. Will I be able to start waging war on my neighbors without these ""ultra"" beings revolting? Will I be able to enslave all that surround me without drawing the ire of the fallen empire bordering me to the north, or will I have to reform my government and start making friends? Only the next 20 hours will tell.			"

                                                        Pros / Things I enjoy about this game : 
- Many options to choose when creating a new custom race when beginning a new game.
Which makes us gamer/customers feel more respected that we get to choose things like our own starting species, species names, council names, ships, starting weapons for starting planet, flags and designs, and the way we run ourselves as a goverment which will affect our relationships with other species we come across.
For example, if we allow purging a colony on a world I just took over due to them being too difficult >:) and allowing slavery or slavery of robots. 
Or choosing to go against those ways completely and give other species their freedom and also robots the option of freedom and their own free will.
The possibilities are endless.
- After colonizing you can choose on the factions tab on the far top left in which you can choose to give the people/ species of that planet their freedom to govern themselves as a new empire/team. 
Which after doing so you are immediatley their protectorate.
In which after you can give them their freedom.
So in short, you can create other teams throughout the game... How good is that! :D
- Game chooses the way the graphics are im fairly sure depending on your machine and what it can handle.
The graphics are amazingly beautiful on my machine :O
- The Price of this game is extremely cheap compared to what you can do in it and how long it will amuse strategy fans...Im completely hooked and im so happy about the price i paid for this game. What a bargain!
- Battling is great fun to watch, and how it will turn out but there is also a con to this pro also :P
- There are many Diplomacy choices to pick from including :
 Insulting someone, choose them to be your Rival, call of war, asking for peace, create an alliance, Become a protectorate or ask another team to be yours, Sending resources, technology, space explored and many others.
- Custom Ship\defence structure design is Amazing. Many options to pick from like :
Choosing the name of the ship
Many Weapons to choose from
Addons like armour, Power cores, Shields
Sections of the ship in the way it will look and what and how many weapon and addon slots they come with.
                                                       Mix between Cons / My Constructive Critisicm : 
- It would be good to have some more character customization options at the start. Likes clothes and also additional options, for example slight face changes and clothes (Armor which represents a war like species, or gowns which represent a more peaceful species - which there are some already in it but would be good to have some more cooler looking ones)
Also maybe being able to change the way our characters look throughout a game, like hair and clothes..My character could want a haircut or decide to change his clothe once in a while as he feels hes starting to smell a bit like Poopoo :P
- Ships are very close together when battling, it would be good if the spacing was a bit more battle friendly on the eyes.
And maybe letting us move our ships when in a battle instead of the computer taking over completely for us to just watch and hope the computer goes about the battle in the most strategic way possible.
For example, if my ship has long range weapons i may wish to keep a distance from the enemy.
While as when the ai takes over it may not move away from the enemy and stay within the enemies medium range weapons which is definitely not the strategy I would have taken as I came out of the battle with my ship destroyed and the battle lost :(
A tiny bit hard to pick up at first with so many options and things to choose from and how the user wants to go about conducting themselves as a nation. But once you've picked it up its completely awesome. Just hang in there and keep at it as its definitely worth it! Trust me
- This is a fairly small con but still im a little picky. The different Zooming stages can be a little annoying to change between to get the view i was happy with.
Maybe creating a few more zooming stages which are closer together with using the mouse wheel would be good.   
                                                                            Summary :
Thats about all i can think of for now. There are many many more things that I love about this game, but i have things to do now, for example, start up Stellaris :D
So yeah I definitely Recommend this game.
If youre thinking whether or not to buy this game, Buy it! Im sure any space or strategy game fan will love it.

Pros:
- Random Systems, Peoples, and Ethics makes for very interesting developments
- Technology research system makes sure that two races never have the same technologies (Thus making research treaties very useful)
- Different FTL modes for empires allows players to find their favorite way to play
- Thoughtful UI makes the game easy and quick to move around the game world once you've figured it out
- No Casus Bellis. A simple ""I war you"" is good enough, because in space you don't need a reason
- Surprisingly approachable for a Paradox game
- Game properly simulates that feeling of discovery
Cons:
- Diplomacy is pretty rusty right now, especially trading
- Espionage is literally nonexistant, but will probably be added with DLC (Possibly as part of the free features?)
- Some mechanics are not disclosed by the tutorial, leaving you to find them yourself
- The AI doesn't always act within it's ethics IE Pacifists are oddly aggressive and seem to be perfectly fine with being in a war as long as it didn't start it
- Ship pathing is wonky, sometimes
Bottom Line: The game is a rich and fun 4x game that hits a lot of good points. In addition, it has a lot of what makes Paradox games fun: The ability to commit horrible atrocities for no good reason other than you're not making that extra +1 Mineral per month.			"

281990,vgpurist,2,2,0,True,43.3,May 10,"Grand Strategy game that has a lot of depth for the base game. 
Let's just get the bad news out of the way first:  
Diplomacy is very much lacking.  It is damn near impossible to trade with alien races even if they are kind of friendly to you. Not to say you can never trade or do anything with them but at this time you can't even just throw a bunch of resources at them to open the borders to your CIVILIAN ships. 
Fights are kinda easy.  All you have to do is make sure your fleet is a bit higher strength than the other fleet and your enemies are almost certain to lose.   There currently aren't any real suprises that could change the outcome of the battle.
Influence is extremely tough to balance as even taking on an alliance partnership can cause it to go negative.  There's nothing (that I could see) that lets you know this.  
There are only 2 ways to win -  Take 40% of the stars or defeat all enemies.  Doing this will probably take forever... and usually at a certain point you know you're going to win and it's just a matter of time.  There should be more victory conditions.  
Now for the good bits:
Graphics are nice as the planets and stars are in 3-D especially when looking closely at the object. 
Every time you play the resources in the star systems are randomized.  This makes for great replayability.  
Also every alien race you meet are randomized in personalities and traits.  You never know who you are going to meet with every gameplay.  
Interface is quite good as the menus are easy to navigate. Giving your ships waypoints are as simple as holding shift and clicking. 
Choosing different leaders can mean the difference between falling behind or staying ahead of the competition in the long run.  
""Primitive"" life can be dealt with in several ways including enslavement!
There's probably more but here's a video to help you along some more:

This game is absolutely worth every penny you spend.  Paradox has a good history of updating their games with free patches and paid DLCs (that are usually worth it).			"
281990,76561197981435714,2,2,0,True,18.6,May 22,"18h isn't much for a Paradox game. And that says everything... I'm not very willing to start a new game. Why?
I wouldn't recommend it for the moment, nor say people ""don't buy it"".
I personally find it much better than other Galactic 4x (endless space and Galactic Civilizations), so it deserves a thumb up, however it is far below other Paradox games, so it would deserve a thumb down.
As tons of people say the early game is awesome. The mid game is boring, if you get lucky enough to reach it. On my last playthrough, in Hard difficulty, everything was going fine. I was on track with other empires. Had some grand strategic movements in mind. A good army on par with others, with about 10 platform defense on the most important points of my Empire.
Good! Good!!
And then... A Fallen Empire declares war. That is something really bad for game balancing as they are completely overpowered compared to other Empires. The guy declares war for forcing me to abandon half of my Empire and sends me a 80K army in my face. I have 5K... And you can't expect to have much much more after 4 hours gameplay.
Game ruined... Have to start another game... Com'on... I play in Very hard since the first Hearts of Iron. I'm playing Ironman in Crusader Kings 2 where I'm twice Emperor and I can't even count how many Realms I have. I'm far from being a newbie in Paradox Games.
Such punitive events cannot happen in a Paradox Game. It would by like if in Hears of Iron you're playing Germany and you have a chance out of x that in 1938 just after the Anschluss EVERYONE declares a war on you (Russia, USA, Japan, France, UK, Poland, Tchekoslovakia, Italy, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Holland...). You can be as strong as you want, you just can't stand such things...
Apart from this kind of stuff the game is well done. Ultra stable. No bugs (for me at least). Very well polished. UI is great. But it feels so empty compared to others Paradox Game.
Don't get me wrong, it's much better than all others 4X / Grand strategy games, but Paradox kind of used me (us) to much better...
Superficial diplomacy. Non existent politics (Ministers? Parties? Government policies like drafting, economy scale, education etc in HOI?). Non existent economy / war economy (convoys? supply to troops (something like that...)). Personalities traits? I don't expect something as deep as Crusader Kings, but com'on... Each Character has 1 trait... No relation effect..
I mean... Paradox seems to me very lazy on this game.
I'm sure they will turn out to be a HUGE game within some years, but at this point... It is sooooooooo below other Paradox games. It's way below day 1 Crusader Kings. I'm a bit disappointed. But yet, it's a good compared to competition			"

281990,Ronnie42,2,2,0,True,23.8,May 12,"Pretty fun game. Started slowly trying to build my Gravemind fleets to help colonise the outer colonies, slowly invading worlds then I started working on clones and mutating my Flood into Xenomorph hybrids....meanwhile in a galaxy far far away Skynet was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at everyone.  
My AI at the time was mostly having the best holiday ever, didn't work so I killed him.
After hearing the constant whining in the Delta quadrant about AI taking over systems...I started to improve my army so I could create an amazing fleet, the only problem was all the races in the galaxy thought my army was more of a threat than the Borg...
Meanwhile one my planets were under attack by an ancient races of demons that were attacking my planets defences, which was quickly wiped out by teraforming the hell out of it.
Ps: This was my first 1 playthrough...I daren't think what my 2nd playthrough will be like, it took me 16 hours roughly to survive before being wiped out by alliances that declared war on me because I decided to build a home-world close to theirs...not because of wiping all life on a planet.

Played some time already. Gets really boring after some time.
Some things need to be fixed and added.
UI, AI, diplomacy need to get an big update.
Getting fast to a time in game where evrything seems so repetative. Build that, move that, find that, research that.. 
Ally AI are stupid in war, their fleet always follow yours even oof you go at your station in home system..
No sabotages/espionages ? Why not? DLC?
No ability to change looks on ships once selected race ship looks. More cosmetic modable ships be nice like in Galactic Civilization game.
Lack of ""goods"" in game. Things you need to terraform etc, Some Techs seem tottaly useless.
Have alot of good stuff to it if you like games like games like master of orion. ( old ones )
As a fan of space games, i cant let this go from me.			"
281990,hdeez,2,2,2,True,64.4,May 12,"Easily the most detailed space strategy game I've played in a long time, maybe ever. This game has all the detail and depth you'd expect from a Paradox game, and has the exceptional UX design that something like Crusader Kings II lacked. There's no long tutorial you must go through before playing, but instead a tutorial assistant that teaches you as you play, although if you are familiar with strategy games you will hardly need it.
Pros:
Tons of species with many varying ship types. You can choose an existing race, build your own, or randomize one. Each faction has it's own beliefs and personlity. If you chose to be a xenophobic faction the game will make you treat other races in a hostile fashion when it comes to dialog. Religios factions will interpret certain events as works of god, and scientific ones will explain them with logic.
You may assign leaders for your faction that serve different purposes (Governor, Admiral, Scientist, General). These leaders will age and die (as will the leader of your empire, no more immortal Ghandi) and will have to be replaced by a younger generation that you will need to recruit. 
The numerous events that you will encounter while exploring the galaxy make it an enjoyable experience. I'm usually not huge on exploring and want to declare war on someone first thing, but Paradox did a great job with numerous alien species to learn about, cosmic happenings to discover, and remenants of old alien empires to uncover. Each of these findings can lead to new technologies as well, as you learn about previously unknown aspects of the galaxy. Example: you can mimic the weaponry of space monsters, and create organic (living) space ships for your faction.
While many empires will start off at the same time as you, and therefore have similar technology levels, there will be some that will not. In one of my games I encounter a fallen empire that had technology and power far superior to mine (or anyone elses). They were not an aggressive faction though, and only wished to protect their holy sites from invaders. In addition as you play other empires may just reach the space age when you are developing far more advanced technologies and will be dwarfed by your advanced ships and numerous armies. You can peacefully coincide with these inferior races or demand they become your vassals.
Speaking of inferior races you will sometimes find worlds that have primitive societies on them while exploring space. These civilizations can be at a variety stages in their development from the iron age to the atomic age. After finding one of these more primitive civilizations you can construct an observation post over their world to monitor them. This post has several different settings:
passive observation - observe them silently and gain some intel
aggressive observation - abduct some of their speciies for experiments and gain a bit more intel
help them into the space age (if they are at a certain point in their development)
and finally the coolest of these options: insert covert agents into their empire through genetic engineering so that over the next couple centuries you can replace all their world leaders and when the time for them to ascend into the stars comes they will welcome you are their overlords and become a part of your empire. THIS IS NOT A JOKE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS AND IT WAS SO COOL. 
Story time. I inserterted covert agents and every now and then they would send me reports of problems they had while trying to infiltrate the alien government and it went like this:
Our agents have landed on the planet, but we had a couple hiccups and had to eleminate all witnessing parties.
Some of our agents were leading a rebellion to overthrow an existing government, but were wiped out while attempting a violent coup. We've managed to recover all the bodies before they could be examined too closely.
We now have thousands of agents on the planet, but one of our top operatives has gone missing we'll keep an eye on it.
The missing agent sends us a message telling us to leave the planet alone, he has fallen in love with one of the aliens.
The rogue agent begins killing off my operatives
The rogue agent attempts to expose the conspiracy to the media, but we have control of mass media by this point so we shut him down
Our evil plans come to pass and the aliens welcome us as their overlords and become a part of my faction's population
After this a sub faction that wants to succeed from our faction emerges and will occasionally cause strikes.
STORY TIME OVER
The space combat fairly hands off, but I would still say it's good and the ship designing part of the game is straight forward.
The AI for the other races seem fairly smart and I haven't had an experience where they've done something horribly out of character.
The game is fairly priced at $40. If you're the type of person that values the time invested in your game, you should get plenty out of this one.
CONS:
You research 3 technologies at a team from three different branches of tech. This is cool, but there's no tech tree that I've found and so the technologies that are available for research seem pretty random at times. 
If you bought it during finals week like me, you may have trouble studying for your finals.			"

I finally crushed the Fallen Empire with barely any lose due to their reverse-engineered Tychon Lance and few other techs.
The thing is you can't bombard them or any planet into oblivion...
And the late game invading alien is not at all terrifying, I prepared all the fleet for them, only to face some ramnents of an invaders. Even then, their plenet is forever immortal that i neet to station some ships to keep bombing it.
I wish to annihilate planets since I am running on massive deficit energy credit to fund my massive high- tech fleet. I had thought it'would take some significant lose against the renewed Fallen Fleet, but no, their number stayed as low as the last time i fought them while I boost new fleet within 40 years.
This is stupid...
Previously
We were once small nations, restricted to a single planet. Discover of proper void craft technology and potential in the vastness of space enable us to move past petty conflicts. We form socio-economic and political union of Human Socialist Republic. The journey began with a small step limited to our sytem and nearby stars.
Every exploration was full of danger and mystery; some were daunting, and some filled us with hope of greatness. Our first confirmed sentinent alien life form brought us fear, anxiety mixed with excitement. Yet it also expanded our horizon. We were lucky that our extended olive branches were responded in kind. Diplomatic relation were formed, exchanges were made with agreement favourable to both parties.
But what truely changed us was not this wondrous relationship, neither were our growing Empire and brother species, rather the sound of War.
Our growing might was first utilized in an opportuned strike against our failing rival; the Associate of Stars, their responds were crushed, and their planets conquered by another of their enemies. We grew confidence, and soon the mighty navy was once again utilized to pacify groups of small rivals.
With numerous vallasages, we turned into an influential Empire of the known galaxy. Benevolence we were, our splendor knew no bound, so was techological knowledge and vast number of fleets. For a moment, we were the greatest empire.
That is....untill we met them.
The Fallen...
As our border expanded, one of our expenitory ship journeyed into the forbidden part of the galaxy. Home to the species once conquered with galaxy before we ever gained sentinent. Their fleet while incomparable to eons past till outmatched and outnumbered us. Twice, we were declared war, and twice we lost. Our home world and numerous others were crushed in the first conflict. Humiliated beyond belief; our leaders rebuilt the fleet into an armada twice its former size. They were equipted with some of the most hi-tech available in the known space. Prepared for the next conflict they said. 
Surely enough, it came, but the result was not what we expected...
Our fleet warped into one of their home systems the moment the mighty and arrogant Fallen Empire declared war on us; intending on annihilate any resistant. Supported by our allies, we carved out a large chunk of their forces and destroyed some of their space ports. But their resistant were fiercer than we anticipated. After months of space battle, our fleet were reduced to merely a sixth of its former size.
In that instant, we once again have to bow to their unreasonable demands. Countless life were lost once again in forced abandoned colonies. 
We were shamed....
Bur for how long?? We know defeat, but we know not to give up
The secrets of their special weapons are now ours. We are now even mightier than before, and soon the armada will be ready.			"

the only problem I have, which maybe removed by user made content, is the battles are stupid after a few minutes into it. The ships all decide to make a huge ball of lights, sounds, and ships. They climp up like a ball of yarn and you can't see anything until its over. Also you can't tell them (that I am aware of) to target anything such as weak ships first or strong ones which the commander in me goes nuts over.
All in all I hope every 4X games gets a lot of idea's from this game and I hope that Stellaris pays tribute to star drive from which most of the races look akin to. (not the ships they did a good job at making those unique)			"

What's good bro?
-STELLAR graphics  (see what I did there :P)
-Intricate tech system
-Fun yet game changing end-game events (wont spoil ;D)
-A more complex sort of rock, paper, scissors fleet combat system
-Interesting resource management along with the addition of strategic resources
-A beautiful galactic map
-Interesting anomaly system - linked with quests
What's not?
-Resource system is somewhat simple and could use a revamp - though it does work
-Planetary Invasion could use a touch up
-War goals could be diversified - at the moment there's not alot of options
-Espionage would be a very interesting addition - with the possibility to incite a revolution
-More techs? Plez? - there is alot, although I think there could be more >:D
-Improvement of the 'quest' system as it can be blocked by trading survey data with other empires as it is mostly reliant on anomalies.

Then you keep growing and you find some troubles here and there, resources, a big guy closeby attacking you. Then you survive and you have been already been playing for 5-10 hours and you are quite big already. You don't have many empires around  that match your force. You keep researching, you keep getting minerals, a few more colonies here and there.
At some point it starts to get quite boring. There are no more unexpected anomalies or discoveries and it is just more and more research and growing a fleet that you don't really need anymore. There is no much to contruct either and also no much to research. There is no incentive to stay inside your own frontiers as there is nothing else to do and going outside will get you slowly against most people around you that will start to fear you and get a huge penalty to your relations.
The limit on leaders is ridiculously small. I am atm with 15 leaders and i have to keep rejecting new ones and running now with only one wandering scientist for a pretty big empire and don't even have space for a general for invasions.

Personally I find that lot of these people who have done reviews are not giving it justice. They'll mention ethos, and then say it's messed up and stupid. Except they don't realize that it gives you special research cards, effects relations of your populace, alien races (both under and not under your control) polices and even the way you govern your empire. The mid game becomes rough because there's many empires to start with normally. It's kind of where the weak normally die off and are obsorbed into stronger empires. If you can't cut it. You sure as hell won't make it late game. Late game I've found is easy if you have what I call a ""5 year plan"" :P For me I plan 5 years ahead. Now if something crazy happens like a robot uprising or a fallen empire wants to tango. I create a plan for that. This game you can't just go ""I'm gonna build ships until I kill him."" because you have to think about these things: Do i have enough energy to upkeep these ships, do I have the material, do I have enough time, how long is it gonna take, should i play defenseive until I get a large fleet or attack now, Should i just wait it out and ask for a ""white peace"" is there anyone who hates him, can I get them to join me, do I have vassels, are they the same ethos as me, what planets do they have colonized, should i liberate and vasslize them, or take their planets, if I take them will it even be worth it, what traits do they have, can I use those traits for my own empire. 
All of this comes into my mind when they declare war. 
If you don't like managing things or figuring out ways around things. This game isn't for you.
Personally I played this game for 44 hours almost straight. That's how good this game is. Now it is hard I have to say. I've started over more times than I can think. I've messed up more times than there are numbers in the universe. The one redeeming feature is it's never the same. I started a super communist country with an ethos of collectivism and a materialist, with comformist and industrialists as race traits. Only after many play throughs did I learn this is the way that I played the best. I could enslave people without penalty to boost my early production. I kind of thought of it as my race banding together to create a better empire, after all fanatic collectivists thought nothing of themselves but to make my race great again :P 
There was a problem I encountered, as I ventured out from my main planet and the watchful eye of my goverment that they started to stray from my collectivist ideas. Thankly though they were comformists so only minor changes happened. As I ventured even farther and put my planets under sectors is when I had problems building. I was forced to use propaganda and re-education to keep my ethos in the population. After all... they're just cogs for my empire. After a while I created  robot armies because my enslaved populace allowed me to focus on research and developement. 
I had finally after 12 hours of effort, war, and colonization spanned 25% of the galaxy, held 38 planets, had genetically modified super soldiers, supported by clone commandos, and a fleet no one could even get into range to fight before they were blown outta the sky. Fallen empires had fought against me, robots had risen to power to try and wipe me out, aliens tried to infest my world, but I had fought them all off. I had finally created my communist empire. We will continue to grow.

281990,lordjoiner,2,2,0,True,18.5,May 22,"Everything you've heard is true. This game is absolutely amazing, full of potential and depth and yet as many have said and still are saying, the game falls flat mid/late game. It doesnt help that achievments are bugged, along with other things. At times the AI players can be very stale and scripted events become wildly underwhelming. Despite all of this, I still had an amazing 18hrs with this game. I spent an hour just creating my government and my species traits. I went on a war path to bring all other species into my fold. I researched, my scientist proclaimed himself a God on an unenlightened planet and I saved the same planet from a mass extinction event. I won't go into big detail repeating what everyone else has said. What I will say though is, kudos for the devs promising to patch in missing content and fix this. I am happy to hear this, but knowing what I know I'd say wait to buy this until they do. If you buy it now you won't have a bad time, but you'll feel what's missing and that may put you off of it entirely. I my self have decided to hang Stellaris up for awhile until all of this gets sorted out.			"

281990,Screed,2,2,0,True,51.9,May 15,"Graphics: 7/10
There is a diverse range of graphical designs for almost everything in the game, it all looks beautiful... but if you zoom in on anything too close, the game lags a lot.
Performance: 8/10
I personally have had no crashes or other performance issues (aside from the aformentioned lag issue), and I play on a Win10 Gaming Laptop. The game runs smoothly, saving takes very little time. 90% of the game is loaded when you start the game so loading times are next-to-nonexistant in-game.
Gameplay: 9/10
Incredibly fun at almost all stages of the game; incredibly diverse amount of options for replayability, roleplay.
*Modding: 10/10
Almost every aspect of this game can be modded; even without any concrete guides existing at this time, I was able to make a trait mod in under an hour just by reverse-engineering the text documents that make up a majority of this game's systems. Modding gameplay is as simple as copy-paste-edit, adding new 2d images as easy as saving a .dds file in GIMP. Highly moddable, great workshop support.
Stellaris is a fantastic game, and the first grand strategy game by Paradox that I have been able to delve into right away, due to a combination of the in-game tutorial system and all of the developer livestreams/dev diaries leading up to the release of the game.
Stellaris combines the typical ""4x"" (""eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"") style of games like Civilization and Sins of a Solar emprie with the ""Grand Strategy"" nature of games like Eu4 and CK2 (games which Paradox made).
In the early game in particular, the 4x element comes into play as you scout out your early starting position, building mining and research outposts anywhere you can within your starting territory. This point in the game has the general feel of ""dipping your toes in the water"" - you don't know what lies right next door to you at this stage. A xenophile pacifist empire who want to be your friends forever? A militarist, collectivist society who see you as a potential threat? Or is it a fallen empire - an empire centuries ahead of you, who thankfully doesn't want to expand, but should you ever cross them they will FLATTEN you?
As the game moves on and you start colonising new worlds, maybe having a few small wars here and there, the Grand Strategy element comes into play. Unlike most 4x space games where you just colonise every world you see even if it isnt very good, you need to weigh your options carefully. You can only control 5 'core worlds' by default, after which you need to split up your worlds into sectors - automated administrative sectors controlled by the AI who will handle the micromanagement for you. This is good overall as it means you don't need to pause the game every five minutes to go through 20 minutes of micromanagement for every single world you own. On the other hand, it can often take the AI several in-game years (and tons of wasted resources) to get completely stable, thriving colonies working for you.
There is a TON of depth to this game; the semi-random technology system means that no two playthroughs will play out exactly the same way. At the time of writing I have yet to even come across the technology for psychic powers, as I haven't played as a spiritualist empire (and they have a higher chance of accessing that technology). By changing the edicts or government type of your empire, you control whether or not yoru citizens get to have free movement throughout the empire in a utopian society free of slavery (organic or synthetic), or you can have a complete dictatorship where only your primary species has any rights, and all xeno scum are seen as fodder or worthless cattle. And anything inbetween, from nearly any scifi media out there, is possible.
A final note; Stellaris is VERY much moddable. To put it in perspective, within the first 3 days of release, there was a cosmetic Warhammer 40k mod. Mods will keep this game going for years to come, I can guarantee that (not to mention Paradox has a track record of keeping up their support for grand strat games going for years as well.
TL:DR; great for grand strategy fans, great for 4x fans, great for sci-fi fans.			"

Ever since that gem of a game (moo) I could not enjoy any 4x games that followed as much. It all seemed either over-complicated or too dumb and uninspired. It made me even think that I don't enjoy 4x genre as much anymore. I could not be more wrong.
Paradox have given us a true successor to MoO2, not in an attempt to re-make the game with flashy graphics but in its deep and rewarding game-play.
Finally, here we have a 4x game that we again do not know what exactly is coming our way when starting a new run. Diplomacy, in a true Paradox fashion has meaning again. Random events, a choice of your nation traits and available research topics will keep you busy finding the best course of action for your empire and will greatly influence the direction your empire will take.

Selecting some decent mods for the game makes it a cut above the genre...my guess is that certain mods will become unnecessary later on if the game is updated and patched up (fleet behaviour, ship balance, economic balance, sector management).
The game does have some novel aspects (such as genetically altering your population species), and I would hope that either the devs or modders take these further (e.g. Don't like your troublesome neighbours?  Unleash a disease on them to genetically alter them to be fugly).
V1.03 and modded up, gets HG's fast food voucher of the week and a big thumbs up.

281990,76561197960270993,2,2,0,True,131.1,June 19,"This game is the beginning of modern 4x games. The guys who made this are strategy game design masters, pure and simple, and the systems and mechanics of the game are interesting, intriguing, and sound. This is the best 4x space game since Master of Orion, and everything is in place for this game to be the 4x masterpiece by which all other games of it's kind will be measured. 4x stands for explore, expand, exterminate, and exploit so let's look at it under those criteria: 
Explore
-Lots of anomolies to explore and read about, although there is only text (needs more interesting graphics), and these run thin by midgame.
-Finding other species,etc is cool and there are dozens of interesting race portraits, with more to come for sure. Discovering other players in multiplayer is a great feeling to be able to look into what race and empire they designed. Fallen empires are cool and tie into certain planets (for instance taking a certain fallen empires ""holy planet"" will make them declare war on you and humiliate you/take it back) 
Expand
-Colonization, war, and race expansion are the strongest part of the game. You have to manage ethics drift which can cause your a race to split off from yours, and DNA changes can make it literally mutate into a different one.
-The war system (you claim war demands, which is limited to a few planets or vassilization, then earn war points to win the war, after which neither race can declare war on each other for 10 years) is thoroughly designed and usually works well; it will be tweaked with every patch I'm sure.
Exterminate
-The weakest part of the game. Everything eventually comes down to your fleet vs. another fleet, and the one that is bigger wins. There is some room here for the better designed fleet to win, but generally the player who built their empire to produce the most ships wins. To make things worse, there are no tactical decisions that can be made during the battle, besides retreating: the only thing that you can do is have well-timed reinforcements. Army and troop design can stop fleets from stealing your planets, but usually only temporarily. The game has a cool view of every system where you can move your fleets like RTS units, but once they encounter another fleet, they are locked in battle and can only fight or retreat. My ideal version of this game has small-medium sizes well-designed fleets that are supported by defense stations/etc so there is a lot of room for strategy. The reality is large balls of ships that instantly destroy any defensive stations, and the only bit of strategy comes from fleet placement and design. They are scheduled begin changes on this 2 patches down the road, but I think this should be the focal point of all patches since the entire game invetably comes down to these messy large tacticless battles.
Exploit
-There are plenty of ways to exploit resources, and exploit races you have conquered by enslaving them or purging them, or even assimilating them and moving them to tiles that are better suited for certain tasks (for instance a ""strong"" species will get extra minerals from a tile with a mine).
-Diplomacy is weak but getting stronger with every patch, and is a focus of the next patch.
If you don't care of the price and like games like this, it's a 100% recommendation otherwise realize that $40 means that the developers think that this is essentially worth 2/3rds of a regular $60 game price. To be honest it feels more like half a game, but the base is most definitely here for a game that will be ""full"" in 6 months and then have patches and DLC come out for a year after that. On that note about DLC, I think people who say this is a DLC platform is very insulting. There is most definitely a full playable game here which will get improved and patched for at least another year. Everyone gets these improvements, and to be honest I would love to buy some cool race portraits for a few bucks and get to see more of them in multiplayer. This game has the brightest future of any game out now. Get it if you dgaf, otherwise come back in 6 months and we can all play together :)			"

I play this like i do every paradox game, with netflix on the other monitor. there is so much micro managing potential that you can get lost, and watching something on the other screen can give you some idea of how much time it takes to do something such as allocate science ships to survey planets.
need some serious tweeking, game at this current state needs the mods from workshop, but they dont fix everything.
one of the best things of the game is micromanaging planets, but by default the game only lets you manage up to 5ish without techs. Then you are forced to let the AI manage them for you via Sectors, the AI is terrible. An auto construction mod helps but isnt perfect. Space battles depend on who has the higher combat number thats all. 
just spent 30months in game years fighting a war against a federation of AI, they were losing, warscore was 100% and they still didnt surrender, so I thought maybe I needed to start negotiations, the only button i could press was surrender.

Story will keep going as I play.
Part 1:
The Great Discoveries, the Golden Age and the Gorf War
The Cynur had grown into a proud Democracy, with their best Prime Minister Traak, the greatest Prime Minister to ever rule Cynndor. The economy was booming and heading into a Golden Age. Their alliance, the Grand Axis, was the only alliance known in the galaxy, and was fairly well in terms of military strength, but strength didn`t bother this pacifist mix of Despotic Empire and Moral Democracy. They were both happy to be at peace. Both at a Golden Age while the rest of the known Empires squabbled. The Bakturians were given up on after they never accepted an invite to the Alliance. The Bos'Pachtux Consortium knew little contact due to their isolationism. The strongest remained the strongest, growing evermore. Until the tiniest known Empire showed it's face. The pacifists of the Grand Axis, as peaceful as they were, did not much care for peace when they saw their lands. The Cynur declared war upon this Empire, the Gorf Empire. Quickly the historic defense fleet established by the first ruler to reach space, Bhundakh, marched proudly to the Gorf Capital. They stood no chance. The Cynur obtained victory as soon as the spaceport of their capital was destroyed. Their planets belonged to the Cynur. The Cynur, had soon begun a great transformation that will not be forgotten.
Part 2: The Transformation of the Confederation
Traak earned his victory, and any titles bestowed upon him. But this was not the end. Traak wanted to spiral the economy upward. So thus, he changed his policies. Slavery was allowed and all Gorf peoples were enslaved ruthlessly. This shocked the Cynur and the Imperial allies of the Cynur in the Grand Axis. But this was not the end. Traak had plans. Plans to conquer. He planned to make the most dramatic change ever to happen to the Cynur.
The Cynuri Empire was about to form.
Meanwhile, the restless slaves on the Gorf Slave Planet grew restless. Even some brave Cynuri and Prime Minister candidates rose up.			"

Biggest complaint is that currently the game becomes less-deep in the mid-late game unlike keeping the action high across all play-types like Civ
Pros
It's like Civ in space at it's simplest.
Diplomacy is its biggest leg-up on Civ I think. Civilizations can break off and form new players, conqering or allying with other people can bring them in as vassals and eventually be under your control. Lots of different layers
Cons
Biggest con is that at the time of this writing, the mid-late game gets stale. Tech upgrades eventually slow down with their impact, border lines remain rather stagnant especially if you are non-military. There are some events that summon strong neutrals that attack everyone, but depending on how much tech you have they may be really easy to wipe out.
I would be really interested to see more events added to the game as that does the best job at mixing things up and having to react.
Fights are largely based on numbers from my experience. Comparing fleet power tells you if you will win the fight or not			"
281990,smearmerchant,2,2,0,True,25.2,June 29,"If you like grand strategy in a sci-fi setting then Stellaris is calling! It has a lot of customization for factions (genetic traits, ethical preferences, goverrnment type and policies) and plenty of in game features to explore (robot populations and giving them rights or having them rebel, uplifting pre-sentient species, fallen empires).
The galaxy maps are ridiculously huge, the tiny map has over 100+ star systems which each have multiple planets or other objects in them. The game has you exploring them with Enterprise like science ships that require leaders to be successful. There are also a number of natural phenomena and space liforms that keep things exciting.
The tech-tree is pretty straight forward divided into three branches of physics, social/biological, and engineering. Ships are designable or you can have the computer make basics and upgrade them to the best available tech. Rare techs are fun and keep things interesting, an example is psionic tehcnology and ground troops. Policy stances are fun too, you can either fight to enslave the galaxy or emancipate it, purge Xenos or welcome them, live by the Prime Directive or bring stone-age civs to space-faring vassal states to name a few!
Combat is a bit simplistic, ordering fleets into battle in systems with no tactical control. I prefer this given the games huge scope but it might be a turn-off to others. Planets upgrades are grid-based zones with populations and improvements. Once you start getting a lot of colonies you can bin them in a sector and have it automate their economics which very helpful. I think the interface and tools like sectors make managing your empire feel less daunting than other 4X games.
This is a fantastic real-time strategy game that will eat your free time like the best of the turn based grand strategies!			"
281990,sindanar,2,2,0,True,36.3,July 1,"I want to say ""EU IV in space"" but it's definitely a different flavour despite the fairly familiar gameplay. It keeps most of the complexity, without feeling simplified.
For those not overly familiar with Europa Universalis, Stellaris is definitely top-of-the-class along with Endless Space as the ultimate 4x space game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).
Fairly easy to get the hang of, there's lots to master and lots of different ways to play - and this combined with the traditionally fantastic mod support that comes with Paradox titles means Stellaris will live a long and well-worn life in my library.
If you like space, and you like grand strategy, then you'll definitely like this. Fair warning though - I probably can't recommend it to someone who can never game for more than an hour at a time.			"
281990,76561198094191756,2,2,0,True,31.4,July 1,"This is a *short* preview, unlike a comprehensive stuff I usually write. So, it's only based on couple of hours of gameplay - and why I even bothered to do this, I'll explain later.
RT 4x space simulation with 'pause', (in spirit) much like beloved MOO2. Meaning - there aren't TOO MUCH distracting, or even irritating stuff - one example would be a 3d research tree - all, restricted to what I saw so far, is done with a measure. 
The space looks very alive and vibrant and with much to be discovered. Special events seem random and unique - think of ones in MOO2 (and don't think of some in... some other games). Oh, custom races are there too, in order to make gameplay more different each time. So are radically different opponents.
In short, I like this game so far. There were critics that 'mid- and end- game are boring and need to be worked on' - and devs admitted that - but, guess what - so are in Civ5. I never finished 3/4 of Civ5 games. And I play Civ-series for, like 25 years, or what was the Day 1 for the shiny, new Civ1 :)
Yet, Civ5 (the *good* Civ5, after 2 expansions) still leaves much to be desired for me. If this game is the same, well, it's on the par with Civ5 - and that means something. It's maybe even a new MOO2 - well, most of reviewer think it would be. I started playing after some patch that 'had a lots of promise', perhaps game was worse before, I wouldn't know. But I like what I see now. Even if it means hundreds of hours of semi-finished game (kind of 'this I would win for sure, if gameplay would be a bit more interesting, to motivate me for 20h more', or 'this is going badly, I *may* be able to pull it through since I play for so long, but... I'm not willing to play that same 20h more). Anyhow, same faults I forgave to Civ5. But with a chance to get better, which is something I can't say about Civ5.
Player will have to learn certain mechanics (not everything is obvious, there is a learning curve) - and from what I experience until now - it's worh it. 
Hardcore 4x fan - try this, or wait for some more polishing. Up to you. People differ - I know some friends that used to say 'but I cannot control well all the space battles manually in Moo2, it's a game flaw', and some which used to say 'Imagine you'd have to *micro* all those 30,000 ships battles (in stacks, to be fair) in Moo1 - what a drag it would be'. 
So, in numerous 4X games, the different 'X' were taken for main feature. So far, I like this proportion. It may change, though...
I'll update this after I had more experience... Anyway, looks good so far and if you're curious as me, perhaps you should buy it. I skipped so many 4x (and played equally much, just to be disappointed), but this one reviews had... something... that drew me to it. For how long, we shall see...			"

281990,76561197986472550,3,4,0,True,88.9,May 18,"So, after a few too many hours lately I decded to add another positive (yet partially mixed) review.
Short Version:
It depends on ""what you expect"" vs. ""what you get"" if you rate a game. I most certainly got what I expected. Long sessions, innovative new research and diverse races without managing every single planet in mid-to-endgame.
Longer story:
The game presents itself as a mixture of 4X and Grand Stategy Games. The latter being the ones Paradox is famous for. Owning quite some PDX games I knew what to expect.
The early game focuses on exploration, research and micromanagement while in midgame it transcends to alliance forging and stabilizing your place in galactic history. Lategame consits of pretty much war waging all over the galaxy with some surprises consisting of extragalactic threats.
The tools you need are there: Ship Designer, diplomacy with (basic) trading, large scale warfare, planetary management, internal policies and politics, nice race designer to fit your needs and wants you to try out those pacifistic, tree hugging spiritualists vs the xenophibic, militaristic despotism. 
That said, the downside is that some things aren't fleshed totally out. Knowing PDX, I'm confident (more likely 100% sure that is) they will add new features by patches and ultimatley larger game-changing mechanics as DLCs. 
For example, while diplomacy contains everything you see e.g. in CIV5 it lacks the depth of an EU4. Or the battles, where fleet composition and tech matters, but I'd like some more tactical options (fleet formations, battlegroups, the like) to turn the tide of battle against and overwhelming foe.
The ingame tutorial is sufficent (imho) and tells you what to do, sometimes why you should do it. Tooltips present the other half of the information you need. Some convience-options are missing (e.g. a list of uncolonized planets would be nice...)
All in all, I think Stellaris in it's current state is a very good and stable game (haven't had any issues yet). Very much worth the money and a great platform for upcoming features (e.g. espionage).
Get it if you like to play 4X games from a different perspective. If you're unsure, check youtube for let's play and developer videos.
P.S.: Get some info about the game mechanics first. Most of them are there for a reason and have pretty much proven themselfes in other PDX titles like warscore (which may be quite unfamiliar to some).			"

By massive chance the race next to me were cats and played by another human player. Things were calm for a while. I prepared for him, as he was eerily quiet. Built a military base with a warp inhibitor next to my space station in the system closest to him. That world and those two bases were incidentally close to his point of possible entry. He declares war and flies his entire fleet into that system without even scouting. A massive, one-sided slaughter ensues. He peaces out after I decimated him. I declare war a few years later and utterly mop the floor with the rest of him. I cut his empire in half and vassalized him.

There are small things that need to be fixed in the game. If you start in a galaxy shape other than elliptical you risk getting cornered early game by an advance start civ and a fallen empire like I did.

Being able to start from knowing of nothing outside your solar system, all the way to running your own empire/federation is fantastic. I still can't get past how cool it is to come across a primitive civilazation and be able to study them and if your will demands it even giving them the knowledge to become a space faring race themselves.

My first two playthroughs I have had my ♥♥♥ kicked. The Arach Horde (an empire of collectivist spiders) was slowly expanding it's borders only to have the AI decide that they do not like spiders and wanted to eradicate them. I have had this happen twice now and had my ♥♥♥ kicked by fleets that were a lot stronger than me.
After a few single player games I started up a multiplayer playthrough with a friend, we settled next to each other and formed an alliance. 
After an hour or two one of the AI's decided he did not like my friend's race and declared war on us, thus declaring war on the whole alliance. At this time we did not yet have a large enough fleet, not only did the other empire bombard my planet instead of the one he declared war upon, we had to play a defending war with guerilla tactics of hit and run in order for him not to completely devestate my planet.
After him being unable to get a foothold on my planet due to my defending forces being superior to his ground troops, he offered us a peace treaty of we ceded two of my planets to him. We accepted, with the idea of taking them back when our military might got higher.
A few hours later, it's midnight, I am supposed to go to sleep because I have work in the morning but we're at war. There is no sleep during wartime.
An hour later our two fleets absolutely obliterated him, he is now my vassal, he has one planet left, his population is enslaved and working in my mines and food laboratories. Little does he know, that soon there will be little left of his previous empire but a smoking planet and the cries of his people as they see their leader get executed as a ways to keep the slaves in check.

I'm only 23 hours into my first campaign but I can tell that Stellaris is going to have my attention for a very long time!
The good: 
Stellaris is gorgeous, fairly intuitive if you're used to the 4x genre, insanely complex and constantly satisfying to play. This is a game that constantly triggers the 'reward' section of my brain with multiple concurrent researching technologies, always busy planets and exploration thats genuinely rewarding. If you get into a 4x so much that you're roleplaying in your head the whole time, Stellaris will make you a very happy player.
The bad:
Stellaris is, for lack of a better word, awkward when it comes to the user interface. It always feels to me like I have either far too much information on my screen taking up valuable space or not enough. There isn't much of a middle ground. While the gameplay in Stellaris is fairly intuitive, there are times when the user interface was so unintutive that I had to look up what to do online; the most glaring example being the correct buttons to press to finish a war. 
Another issue I have with Stellaris is the transition between the Stellar and Galactic maps... I loved Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion for a thousand reasons but one of the things I miss in Stellaris that was so simple in Sins is the option to scroll out from the Stellar map to the Galactic map... Its just so intuitive in Sins but in Stellaris you have to go click a button or press a key to transition between the two. Its nit-picking, yes, but its something I missed many times during play already.
In closing, Stellaris took me on a journey across the stars that has been full of great unexpected moments of story development, exploration, gorgeous discoveries and so much more. It's worth your time if you like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion or any of the other space 4x's... Just be ready to switch your thinking back to RTS from turn based!			"

281990,76561198001740846,3,4,0,True,112.2,June 1,"At first glance Stellaris looks intimidating and daunting. There's such a wide variety of interfaces, choices, customizations and so forth that enables you to truly craft the empire and species of your nerdiest sci-fi dreams. Stellaris is really all of your favorite sci-fi elements and films roled into one package and the combinations are endless. Mass drivers, missles, torpedoes, lasers... you pick, all of these are available for you to focus your empires combat effectiveness.
Also as a side note, one of the most under-mentioned and truly epic pieces of this game, is the amazing soundtrack. You have orchestral and synthetic sounds of superb quality.
After having spent 50 hours the last two weeks binging on stellaris, and having one game run 200 years, I am starting to notice a pattern develop. While every game is truly unique and totally different from the last, Stellaris starts to become much more familiar and easier the more you play it. Much like Crusader Kings 2. You'll be focused on balancing your economy at first, then getting your tech up to snuff. Neglect one and a militant facist religous empire may wipe you off the map in less than 100 years. If you manage to survive into the mid game you'll be faced with a series of choices for your techs that may or may not end the galaxy. The late game as far as I have witnessed is spent trying to clean up an end game crisis and reach that victory condition of 40% control.
The only downside I have for this game is after awhile it feels a bit bare bones. No civilian trade lanes. Combat is basic, your swarm of ships vs my swarm of ships, usually highest value wins. No other victory conditions besides conquest (hard if your a pacifist). Terraforming is very limited. Diplomacy is very limited. Options to bring an empire into your fold are limited and so forth. All of these things have been noted by the community and I have full faith in Paradox that these will be addressed in the future.
I know over time as Paradox always does, this game will be fleshed out and probably end up completely different than it is now in two years. Paradox has started with a great initial package, truly nailing what every nerd has been wanting for so long in a stagnate genre.

It really lacks depth compared to other games Paradox has done like CK2 and EU4. First few hours are interesting, discovering anomalies, other species and systems. But after few hours you see that game lacks. I feel that there are not much events, but events that are there are very well written, diplomacy lacks unlike EU4 and there are more thinks that feel underdevelped like Ai. It is passive and never attacked me.
          But even with all the things the game lacks I can't stop playing it, I have really good time also. The race designer, customizationm, dialogue and that excitment and wonder I felt when playing is awesome in my opinion. There are many more things this game does really good and in my opinion and they overweight the bad ones.
           First I didn't know if to recommend or not this game, I would at the momment give it something in the middle. But knowing Paradox I am sure that they will work on this game in months and maybe years to come. More work on the AI, more events and some quality of life improvemts and this game will be superb.

Have seen better space battles and diplomacy, I may never get to give a complete review of this game due to time constraints, but do want to leave some form a review based on what I have played so far. The best way to do this would be to write up my last experience playing Stellaris.
Late evening loaded up the game, played for about an hour then heard the cries of my 7 month old daughter, got her up and held her while shushing her to sleep.

281990,76561198013517782,3,4,0,True,162.4,May 15,"For me, personally, Stellaris is the ""colonize the Galaxy"" game I've waited for all my life.  
I grew up reading science fiction.  The first thing I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.  (Maybe that was a result of seeing the moon landings live on TV when I was a kid.)  When I was a child, I was convinced that by now people would be living on the moon.  Reality has been a severe disappointment, in that respect.
Since there are no moon colonies or manned expeditions or anything at all of that nature in real life, I've been reduced to living out my dreams of space vicariously.  I've played just about every space 4x game ever released.  (I won't bore you with a list.)  Most of them scratched the itch to a greater or lesser extent, but none of them ever truly did the job.  (My favorite up till now was MOO2, but even that became tiresome after extensive play -- because in the end much of it just boiled down to an exercise in production system optimization, which always came to feel like a rote exercise.)
Then came Stellaris.
To begin with, Stellaris is not afflicted by a limited pool of races that can be played as or played against, such that sooner or later the game becomes a succession of variations on living in the same neighborhood.  I've spent hours already just designing factions I want to play as at some point (created a representation of the human society from Starship Troopers, for instance), and I haven't even started on alien races yet, just humans.  And the fact that all in-game races I might meet are procedurally generated means that I'll never have anything like the same game twice.  Which, in and of itself, begins to establish the feeling of a real Galaxy.
Beyond that, the game creates its own great stories.  For example, in my first play through, by the time the piracy event fired, I was down to a fleet of two corvettes.  (Damned space crystals.)  I recruited an admiral and sent my fleet of two corvettes to see what the Pirates had planned.  The orders were to shadow them and observe.  The admiral stood off and watched them begin their attack run on one of my science stations.  I figured it would be game over for the station soon enough.  But then the station began to fight back, and didn't die immediately, and as the admiral I couldn't bring myself to just watch it go down swinging.  Plus my two ships might be able to do some damage fighting alongside the station.  So we intervened.  With the result that my fleet was reduced to one remaining corvette almost immediately.  Confronted by the fact that I was about to have no fleet left at all, my admiral hit the emergency FTL button.  And then I got this event that said my admiral was taking it really hard that she'd abandoned the station to its doom, and that she was never going to do that again.  And she got a trait that made her better at combat, but that also meant she would never, ever disengage from a fight in the future.
I've never had a story-telling experience like that in a space game before.  And it changed the course of the story going forward, too, because from that point on I had to be a bit more careful about how I used that admiral, given that there would be no retreat for her from any battle.
And the feeling of being in a living world got stronger.
I could go on and on, but the bottom line is:  for me, personally, Stellaris is the first game to truly give me the feeling of participating in the history of a stellar empire.  Which is what I've been waiting for all my life.
(The game's not perfect, some things need to be fixed, others could be expanded upon, but I have confidence all that will happen in time, given Paradox's track record, and the things it does have are priceless to me.  I'm grateful for what it does have, rather than lamenting what it doesn't  have yet.)
Now, keep in mind that this is my own personal opinion.  And as the Romans used to say, there's no point in arguing over matters of taste.  And Stellaris is clearly not for everyone.  
But for me it will be my go-to game from now on.			"

281990,RafiRandy,3,4,0,True,41.5,May 18,"First of all I am going to say that this game is amazing. It has a scope no other Paradox game to date has had and now encompasses an entire Galaxy not just planet earth. For Paradox's first venture into space it is magnificent, capturing both 4x style games and the Paradox feel. The game is by far the easiest to pick up, shedding the previous  annoyances of learning games Victoria II or Hearts of Iron 3. In my first 25 or so hours I have played around 4 games. The first three were unmodded and were mainly learning mechanisms for the different travelling styles and weapon types as well as different Tech orders. I switched from Avian slavers to Reptilian warriors and then to Tech obsessed penguins. However this is not what made the game the best 4x out there, no not all. Whilst the game is fun, ituitive and nicely paced ; the real reason Stellaris is a gem is due to the fact that it is so easy to mod. During the first week I was able to find a mod that allowed my Humans to look like Soviet esque pops and also managed to find a soviet style emblems and name lists. After this I delved back in to my 4th game as the Soviet Union....in space. My leader is Vladamir Lenin who is now 108 years old and still going, and my empire has managed to become the most industrialised out there. Being able to create and customise races and governments to create your own civilisations is what makes the game amazing. The immersion and roleplaying effects are immense and you can really feel for your fledgling Empire as it takes its first steps into space. For this reason alone I am going to say this game has to be on the top of your list of buys. But with the game mechanics being so smooth and the game so addictive I would have to say buy it now!

It's fun to read the Anomolies your science ships find. A lot of them are references to sci-fi shows and movies. They aren't annoying and you find yourself getting sucked into the story lines of some.
It takes a little bit of trial and error when you first start. But thankfully it has a wonderful tutorial system to help you find your way the first couple times.
Once you get the hang of it and think you are doing great. You suddenly meet an advanced and very angery race of aliens. Who view you as weak and most purg you from existance. A few minutes later your killer fleet is bieng laughed at and destoryed. Along with your hope of ever becoming anything more. Lesson learned

Amazing game overall. However the negative reviews have a point as well. Was launched incomplete and full of bugs. Combat could be better. AI and interactions could be better.

281990,derfinsterling,3,4,0,True,43.1,June 5,"I've been a long-time fan of Paradox and their game and was eagerly looking forward to their first game set in space.
The early game is fantastic. Early exploration, trying to get the economy going, potentially fighting off (stronger) neighboring empires. And there's nothing like watching your proud fleet being decimated to nothing by a supposedly weaker neighbor, just because you didn't invest in shields against their mighty energy weapons.
Now, there's still some bad. As others have noted, the game bogs down after a few hours. Once you have expanded, sectors are the key to keep micro-management to a minimum.
However, those have got to be tweaked through patches... as there is still plenty of micro-management going on: 
 - You can't assign ships to these sectors, so you have to hope that they create their own construction ships.
 - That means that you need to build up multiple fleets and have to manually patrol them. While you can your fleet to be aggressive and basically attack any enemy station of ship in the same system, it would help if you could also designate a defensive fleet patrolling a sector.
 - Collecting debris after battles is a nightmare.
 - Assembling fleets is tedious if you want to spread it out across your empire. It would be better if you could design your fleets and then the various space ports in your empire start producing the required ships as needed and sending them to their rendezvous point.
But all of these issues, while annoying, have not kept me from thoroughly enjoying the game. Highly recommended!			"

However, the beginning and, from what I've heard the end also, are such a joy to play I still have no problem in recommending.

281990,76561198014527861,3,4,0,True,66.4,May 24,"I have been playing Paradox games for some years now, and despite being a very loyal fan and supporter of their historical grand strategy game series, I have generally followed the ""wait until a couple expansions"" rule of thumb with their games. I purchased Stellaris because it was the first new franchise from Paradox in some time and was looking for a new strategy game outlet.  I am not a sci-fi game fan for any genre and I am aware of the varying states of polish associated with new releases.  
That said, this game is out-of-the-box fun.  The exploration component remains a consistent element of the game well through mid-game and depth of different component systems; from ship design to technological progress to diplomacy and planet planning and developement are all well thought out systems and well executed.  There is sufficient enough differences betwen the pre-start choices of ethics and species talents to create an asymetical feel from one species/empire to another.  The procedural generation of the worlds is not overly balanced, which present frustrations (e.g. not enough minernals near starting star systems can be a real drag on early game building capacities) but it also prevents cookie cutter, scripted opening strategies and pushes the player to adapt to the strategic map as it is unveiled.  This keeps you thinking from game to game and evolving new approaches to handle complex and emerging landscapes.   
Overall, despite being a new release without supplemental dlc to flesh our and refine, this game in its current state stands as one of the most complete and deep vanilla Paradox games I have played to date.  I am enjoying it now and look forward to watching it continue to evolve.  
Well done, Paradox.  Your commitment to releasing games in a finished state is changing perceptions and your willingness to take the risk associated with launching a new franchise appears to be on its way to paying off.			"

281990,mizugori,3,4,0,True,117.2,May 23,"Stellaris is a  great game. It draws elements from Civilization, Master of Orion, and Sins of a Solar Empire, without feeling like a clone of any one of those games. It is real time, but it almost feels turn-based because you can adjust the speed and pause at any time (and yes, you can continue to issue orders while paused.)
There is a bit of a learning curve, even if you are a master of the aforementioned games, so please do yourself a favor and click the ""full tutorial"" button when you start your first several games. There are a lot of nuances and advanced concepts, (such as genetically modifying races) that you are not going to figure out on your own - you need the instructions the first time or two.
There are a few bugs which need to be worked out, but the ones I encountered were all very minor and did not impact gameplay much (for example, I encountered a situation where the random name generators stopped working and I had to restart to fix it, and another situation where I had a strategic resource and it showed up in my resource bar, but when trying to construct something which required that resource, the game was telling me I did not possess the resource.)

Edit: What I mean by ""just came out"" is that it may seem barebones now compared to other titles, especially Paradox titles that have been out a while.

I'm honestly surprised they were able to put so much depth into a 4X title, and not have it completely collapse on launch day. The dynamically generated storyline quests (which are entirely optional) have about enough text to fill a novel. And it's not just a bunch of filler - it's actually really interesting stuff to follow through. Unique storylines and lore is developed based on your custom creatures/races, and seems to also have some random generation thrown in too to ensure that you don't find yourself repeating the same paths.
Outside of that, Stellaris is full of depth just about everywhere else. The level of micromanagement you'll need to do mid/late-game can be a bit exhausting, but unfortunately that's true of most 4X titles.
However, the early game is much improved over most other Grand Strategy titles; the tutorials are extremely helpful, and the natural difficulty/complexity level ramps up nicely with your hours invested.
If you're a fan of the genre, yeah, it's well worth a purchase. If you've never played a grand strategy/4X title before, then this is probably the best starting point on the market at the moment. Just er, don't go to sleep at 5.30am. You'll probably miss work the next day.			"

281990,76561198078375209,3,4,0,True,74.9,June 3,"Stellaris - Review // UPDATE 1.1
Stellaris strikes me as a very refreshing, yet pleasantly familiar space 4X at the same time and reminds me the most of a very ancient DOS-based 4X called Ascendancy.
It just so happens that Ascendancy was also the very first 4X I have ever played in my life, and it also happens that very few other space 4X's after that managed to keep my attention as long as that one in nearly twenty years.
But with Stellaris, the whole thing is back. Forget GalCiv 3, forget MoO. Stellaris does it all, does it right, and probably has the most reliable and supreme patch support after release of all three. DLC? No - major updates for free, and you will only pay for actual new content and only if you really want to - not because the deeper game mechanics actually force you to. Paradox approaches games the way they should be approached: as a living product that is never truly perfect. Evidenced by not only their own patch and aftersale support history, but also by enabled Mod Support from day one.
The base game Stellaris is a feature-rich and feature-complete 4X that offers, starting with update 1.1 ""Clarke"", some of the most interesting AI/diplomacy strategies, and a micro-to-macro style of gameplay that is perfectly in sync with the way your stellar empire grows in size (over time, the game allows you to move micro managing to 'Sectors' that are auto-governed and puts a soft cap on the number of planets you have direct control of).
All of the above still leaves one of the most enticing and cool bits of this game behind: the absolutely brilliant writing. Literally every trigger, every event and every action is meaningful, well narrated and invites you to immerse yourself in your space empire. Combined with the absolute freedom in your rise to power, this gives the otherwise 100% random generated universe great body and context.
If I were to name one drawback of the game, it's that you can't press 'One more turn'... You just end up looking at the clock at some point, which is usually a bunch of hours later than you really intended to.			"

The Gameplay is truly addictive...from naming your empire, making a flag to even designing what kind of ships you what in your fleets and naming those too...repeating this process over and over again is always a new experience.

Stellaris is a great game in general with some flaws that can be fixed to improve the gameplay.
Lets start by going over the PROS/CONS
====================================================================================
PROS:
-Perfect Europa Style Sci-fi Society game (In my Opinion)
-Stunning Graphics
-Numerous amounts of Technologies
-Perfect to kill time
-Many game mechanics to learn/discover
-Nice Micromanagement mechanics
-Extremely fun with friends
====================================================================================
CONS:
-Repititive and Bland Mid-Game (All you in Mid Game is Research,Colonize,Micromanage, and Build up your fleet)
-Only one thing left to do late game *Become Hitler* 
-Diplomacy is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (The ""Threat' Level, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Just after taking ONE PLANET goes up to 500?!) Ok then
-Sector AI (OOOOOOOOOOO I HATE THE SECTOR AI SOOO F****** MUCH!)
-""End Game Crisis"" (Kiss my F******* A** End Game Crisis, that ♥♥♥♥ aint even a worth my time, not even a challenge)
-Listen closely, ya listening? Ok,good....I DO NOT WANT TO COMPLETE THE MONUMENTAL TASK OF CONQUERING EVERY OTHER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EMPIRE! (Late game sucks btw, thats all you can really do)
-OP ASF Strategies (Ex: Corvette Swarm, Tachyon Lances, Tachyon Lances, oh and did I mention TACHYON LANCES?)
====================================================================================
Some things I want for the future:
-New FTL Megastructures (Ex: Warp Conduit,Slipstream Generator,Portal network module)
I'll explain these later ._.
In conclusion, Stellaris is a great at first, but gets repetitive as you play is more. 
Why do I have more than 100 Hours? Im patient....with no life....and no friends......
ANYWAYS! I still think Stellaris is still a good game and can be improved if these flaws are fixed! :3
peace ♥♥♥♥♥es

But this game has many good features working so well together, it's just insane. Don't pass up!
 
Just internal view outside of general pros and cons:
Developer promised more content and interations
Modding potential is extreme for the future 
Tutorial is rough, make sure to read on-line guides
UI is decent but a bit overwhelming
Colonisation is not an easy task, no planet filters by type, size etc.

The fun takes a huge nosedive after you reach the mid-game. You'll find yourself having the time running at fastest for minutes waiting for something to happen. The lack of diplomacy, dumb AI and lack of late-game progress all contribute to this.
But the main issue is performance. When you expand and explore the entire map, the game will stutter, freeze and run at <20fps regardless of your rig. I couldn't even force myself to finish it, it's devolved into a laggy slideshow  - where even with nothing going on, the timer of the game will continuously freeze.
Unless you are a die-hard-thirsty 4x fan, I recommend you avoid Stellaris. Maybe grab it on sale in a few months, with hopes that it's will be patched on it's glaring weak points.			"

At launch i found no problems, the game ran so smooth even on my Potatoe. Combat is just stellar to watch, flashing light, colors, and majestic ships flying about in a dance to the death. Creating your own race to rule the stars, Have a 110 year old Mushroom control the fate of his people. The game is wow, and after looking through the negative reviews, all i see is comparisons to other games. The main comparisons are Crusader kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4, Claiming both games have significantly more deapth. My question to them is, how much depth did either game have at release compared to this game? Stellaris release with so much content and the dev already outlined the major concerns the community has. Depth was added to CK2 and EU4, Stellaris has some depth and will only get more with time.Mostly everyone who reviewed it on its own merits gave it positive reviews. The question comes down to would you recommend this game? If you want to subjegate humans, be annihalated by parrots, or form a alliance consisting only of reptiles and call it the COLD BLOODED COALITION....Then start a COLD WAR....Then don't hesitate to pick up the game. If you don't like 4X or Grand stradegy, probably not the game for you, but i say give it a shot.

281990,myqt,3,4,0,False,55.5,May 9,"It has potential, that's for sure.
My main complaints is: 
-The amazingly stupid sector management AI which can't even put slaves and robots in the correct tiles. They keep putting them to farm energy credits and research points while ignoring the fact that slaves and robots (except synthetics) have disadvantages to farm it.
-Non-existent diplomacy. It's so simple it hurts. Declare war, trade resources, declare rivalry, insult them. Just that. As for the casus belli for war, currently the choices are very limited. Giving only 3 choices; cede planet, vassalize, or liberate some of their planets.
The only part I definitely love playing is the early-game stage, you'd be surprised at what events the game will throw at you when you start to explore the galaxy. 
The mid-game? It's your average Europa Universalis IV, but imagine it without any DLC. Yeah, that's it. Here's what you do during mid-game:
-Build ships.
-Wait for your tech research to complete.
-Upgrade your ships with the latest weapons you acquired from research.
-Declare war.
Rinse and repeat, since there's no other thing except warring other states to ""win"" this game.
Late-game stage is bugged. Foreign invaders? Sure thing, the AI doesn't even fight them! Except for Fallen Empires, that is. I still remember when the Unbidden appears, it only gave opinion bonus to all AI states, making them forming federation here and there. But because of that federation, they won't declare war to each other since they're locking each other. That creates a horribly static galaxy which nothing happens, even when Unbidden starts swallowing those states, they don't do anything!
Then again, it's not like I hate this game or something, but currently it feels like an incomplete game. Perhaps in a year or so, when PDS releases some DLCs for this it'll be as good as CK2 or EU4, or even Vicky 2.			"

The AI acts like I would expect.  Some games are brutally short, some games are epic.  There are even some games that drag out into a huge stalemate of politics.  Pretty realistic.  There are flaws in the design, but Paradox seems to be addressing those pretty quickly.
There are some complaints about the ship design having no impact.  Yes, the tactical combat can become something of a slugfest early on.  But by mid-game having a balanced fleet can really impact your battles.  Make some heavily shielded/armored ships with short range weapons to act as tank, use some point defence ships to stop missles, build some bigger snipe type ships for the rear.  These can make a significant difference in combat.  Paradox has addressed some of these concerns in the latest patch, extending the range of weapons causing the ships to stand off more during combat.
Also, they addressed the empire management so that the AI governors more closely do what you expect of them.
There's some more work to do, but the scope of this game is amazing.  It's definetely a huge step in the pausable RTS, 4X generation.  There's tons of races, tons of techs, and amazing graphics.
There will probably be a better game to come along in the future, but it probably won't be for many years.  I'm happy I pulled the trigger on got this in my Library.  It will be remain on my hard drive for a long time.			"

281990,76561197966720005,4,6,0,True,53.0,May 25,"Stellaris is not perfect. The UI is still, even after a few patches, a bit clunky for someone who hasn't weaned themselves on an earlier Paradox title to get used to. The AI is not terribly bright, particularly when it comes to moving fleets. Victory is achieved exclusively through military hegemony: you either make every starfaring race your vassals, wipe them out, or claim the majority of the habitable worlds in the galaxy. 
Despite its flaws, Stellaris is still a lot of fun to play, and has a lot of room to grow. Paradox have brought together some of my favorite features from other games, both from other 4X space games and Paradox's other titles. Its diplomacy system is very similar to the one in Europa Universalis. It has a first contact system that is very reminiscent of the one in Sword of the Stars, where you can never be certain if an unknown alien ship is going to be hostile or not. Stellaris also has Grand Menaces that can really shake up a stagnant late game, much like Sword of the Stars. The ability (and in fact it is necessary once your empire starts to really grow) to automate ""sectors"" under the rule of leader characters also gives the game a tiny bit of a Crusader Kings 2 vibe, especially when those sectors begin to get unruly.
By far my favorite part of Stellaris, and what truly sets it apart from other entries in the genre, is how I end up talking about it. I won't tell someone about how I couldn't win a war until after I advanced my ground combat tech; I'll tell them about how my squishy fungus people were so miserable at ground-fighting that I had to develop artificial intelligence and build legions of droid soldiers to fight my wars for me. I won't tell someone that robotics technologies let you construct pops that don't have penalties on worlds that your species can barely inhabit; I'll talk about how the advent of independent robots allowed my empire to colonize and exploit worlds that were beyond our abilities before, as we seeded entire worlds with billions of AI-controlled robots to mine worlds with prohibitively harsh climates. I won't say that I lost the game because my reliance on AI techs meant that an event triggering an AI rebellion was beyond my means to put down. I'll tell people that I reached too far, grasped for too much, and ultimately built the steel boots that would be at my neck.
Stellaris is not a perfect game, but it oozes potential, and Paradox has proven in the past that given time, patches, and DLC, they can deliver on that potential. I'd understand if you didn't buy Stellaris now, but at the very least it belongs on your wishlist, because this is a game to keep an eye on.			"

Moreover, Paradox has a great reputation for patching games and making DLC that is worth buying. Now the game, the core concept of a grand strategy and 4x game is great. Unique tech discovery system and ethos system. There is no one ""right"" way to play the game. Every ethos and government has there advantages and disadvantges. The current state of the game lacks A.I. optmization, a frusting UI, and some balance issues. In it's current state it is definitely worth to buy, however Paradox is going to release patches for the aforementioned product (with the next major  one coming in about a week).

281990,Nikriontra,4,6,0,True,34.3,June 4,"A really well made 4x strategy game set in space with great visuals. 
Pros:
>Great empire builder allowing you to edit every factor of your nation from cosmetics to governing policies and ideologies, from a big selection allowing for varied nations in every game.
>Strong and entertaining early-game, with interesting anomoly popups and early diplomacy with other factions. 
>Indepth ship builder allowing you to create your own classes of ships using a range of weapons, shields etc that you researched ingame.
>Downright FANTASTIC visuals. Planets and solar systems are beautifully rendered, and the 2D alien avatars in diplomacy and pop windows are drawn beautifully.
>Satisfying fleet battles, especially between two 10k+ stacks. Lasers shooting around, rockets exploding, bombers and fighter jets shooting lasers. It's pretty epic. 
>Engaging user-friendly planet modification, in which planets are divided into seperate tiles, each with different resources. Each tile allows you to build one building that boosts that tile's production or contributes to the planet's overall resource output. You can also manage your population much more easily.
>Massive research trees divided into three categories give you a wide range of new things to see, unlock and create. 
>Epic science-fiction themed soundtrack that never gets tiring to listen to.
>A ground forces system where you have to recruit armies on your own planets and ferry them to enemy planets to occupy. It's okay, but generally gets bogged down in the furious scrolling and clicking during a war.
>Mod support, giving you access to a ton of incredible gameplay and graphics enhancements that ultimately improve your gameplay experience. 
Cons:
>Very weak mid/late-game. After you finish exploring the galaxy there are no more interesting pop ups and random events like in Europa Universalis IV. You just tend to build ships in between wars and watch your empire slowly grow. 
>Terrible AI team mechanics. If you're in an alliance and you go to war with another empire, your ally's fleets will follow yours around resulting in a giant death stack. You're unable to set up planets for them to occupy or blockade like you can with ally troops in EUIV. Generally your occupied planets will be taken back because your ally is too stupid to leave forces behind.
>Shallow diplomacy mechanics, limiting you to trade deals, war declaration and vassalisation demands. If you're in a war where the AI is the warleader, you may find yourself ripping your hair out because the warleader is too stubborn to peace out.  The Nation comparison box needs to show percentages, not ""Superior, overwhelming, inferior."" I often end up wrecking 'superior' nations just because they have a couple of corvettes more than I do and have a ""level 3 power plant"" research that I don't have. 
>Lacking rebel faction interactions makes it very difficult to deal with rebel uprisings if your influence income is low. There needs to be better ways of pleasing rebels and easing revolt rather than bribing leaders and suppressing media. 
>More indepth sector management. The game at start caps you to being able to rule over 5 planets. After that you need to create sectors in order to have more planets in your empire. Sectors are essentially micro thriving sub-nations within your empire that will focus on building specific buildings that you can set in the empire screen. However they restrict you in your ability to manage the population especially when there's divergence leading to a rebellion. This causes problems. 
>Various bugs and glitches with the AI here and there. Examples include: An enemy 12k fleet had gotten stuck in the edge of a solar system trying to evade my allied death stack and ended up getting destroyed rather than warping away. Another example is that my ally had two planets right on the border of a Fallen Empire. Everytime their truce was up the Empire would declare war, kick my ally's â™¥â™¥â™¥ and force my ally to abandon the two planets. As soon as the war ended my ally would recolonise the planets and the cycle repeated itself. It was irritating to say the least.
Despite its flaws Stellaris has huge potential to improve. Knowing Paradox, i expect alot of DLC packs to come out soon. If you like EUIV and Victoria 2 and are a fan of science fiction, this is the game for you.			"

281990,AlexTheClown,4,6,0,True,68.3,June 3,My first Grand Strategy game and I love it.			
281990,kentlang,4,6,0,True,95.3,May 16,"The game is a 4x space colonization game where you create custom alien races with the goal of either wiping out all other living things in the galaxy or taking over a large portion (40%) of the potentially habitable planets in the galaxy.
What sets Stellaris apart from other space 4x games (like for instance Galactic Civilizations II) is that Stellaris has that Paradoxian game design that is core to all of their games: I mean in the way you wage wars. You always have to set wargoals in the game to get things out of wars and this goes for the AI too. This means that opponents nor you can go on coquering sprees. Alliances also have an unanimous voting system which means; in theory that alliances work more like defensive pacts than offensive ones. The game also feature a very interesting technology system where you get a random selection of technologies to research to progress forward. This doesn't mean that you can get randomly high techs without fulfilling the prerequisities. However you can skip tech levels through reverse engineering the ship debris of your opponents. You can also create your custom race and government type and interact with other species through that race. Friction usually spawns between civilizations with different government types and ethics.
The gameplay is solid but Stellaris isn't without its problems though, and I have a couple of major complaints.
1). Stellaris is too slow paced throughout the game! It takes ages to finish a match, much as if the only time setting you could put on your Civ game was ""Marathon"". Now some gamers are going to be perfectly fine with this, as they have more free time as I have - but I see it as a major dissapointment. This isn't something you can easily and comfortably combine with demanding work or university studies.
Stellaris probably wont ever fix this problem as it is a problem very common with all their games. It takes very long to finish any of them, but they're also paced differently. They're historially based games with times when you have to let your manpower recover or just let time pass. In Stellaris you're always supposed to expand somehow, either through throwing up more research, building more colonyship or surveying more stars. This is why the design isn't working as well in Stellaris and also HoI3.
2). The AI isn't aggressive enough, and this is very sad. I've played about 100 hours already of Stellaris and I've only been conquered once and that was when I was ignoring the military entirely. If the player even tries to fight back the AI will have a lot of trouble dealing with the player, and it seems to be a combined problem with how they design their ships and the strategic determination of the AI. The AI does compete pretty well with the player in technology or industry, but in military - the AI is nearly helpless unless the AI have vastly superior numbers.
3) Some of the features of the game is broken or missing. Such as slavery for instance. Slaves will never revolt and they don't have many drawbacks associated with them. They insinuated through some of their streams that they would be fixing that issue eventually though. This is true also for purges which seems to only inhibit your diplomatic relations with regular opponents but otherwise don't cause many other major drawbacks.
However with some polish and modifications this could be a great game, and the times I've been enjoying myself in the game - I've enjoyed myself quite a bit. So that's why I recommend it.			"

We'll start with the positives, The game is definitely remarkable in the aspesct that it brings us some genuinely enjoyable gameplay in the form of 4X real time elements. There are no turns to take, everything happens in front of you. 
Early on in the game there is much to do, technologies to research, planets to colonize, learning who your galactic neighbors are, what they are.
In my case, in a game with a friend, I spawned in dangerously close to a fallen empire. 
That was a good and bad thing, being xenophiles they had no intention of killing me out as long as I do not enslave/purge my citizens. This essentially meant that my border was secure, so long as I didn't atttract their Ire. The bad thing was that I could no longer expand to the south of the galaxy. 
I soon learned that I was surrounded by many different empires, that the west side of the galaxy was densely populated by different alien races whose goals and ideals differed exponentially. 
My friend in game, spawning on the far eastern side of the galaxy, was having a completely different experience. His empire expanded quickly and was given an opportunity to really grow his borders, While his empire was bigger, this also meant that all the other empires in the east were also a healthy size due to the sparcity of galactic neighbors.
Soon, both east and west started to effectively garner their own cultures, if you will.
The west was densely populated with many small nations in alliances, and also highly technologically advanced due to their being very few wars.
The east was the exact opposite, no alliances, many large nations, many large fleets. Huge wars raged all over the East, and due to their increased military spending, those nations could not afford to invest in technological advancement. 
I thought this to be a truly interesting parallel, one the game definitely delivers well. 
The late-mid game is dull however, I eventually declared war on my neighbor when the West fell to pieces and started tearing itself apart with massive battles with highly technologically advanced fleets, completely reshaping the western borders. 
I vassalized a smaller nation, while simultaneously taking some planets from another nation by force. The vassal was fiercely loyal before being integrated. While the other nations' planets I had annexed inhabitants started a faction in order to defy my rule. 
After dealing with the insurrectionists and succesfully integrating the other nation, the prethoryn appeared in our galaxy to the east.
Spawning in my friends' empire, decimating it in mere minutes. 
He now has his last fleet holding at his nations' capital. With massive defensive starbases and stationary weapons waiting for an overwhelming extragalactic force to consume his people.
While I sit comfortably in the West, building up my fleet for an opponent I may never actually fight.
Better him than me, I suppose.

What does it do that I have never seen before? 
- The Race system. This is both the construction of your race, the intereactions with others, and how all of this intertwines itself with ethics, politics, and governemnt of your empire. 
- The event system. This is mostly into early and mid game but exploring the galaxy is really fun. I think it makes having a more empty map even more fun than a heavily populated one.
- The battle system - for a grand strategy I find the battle system a good compromise. IT is not too abstracted that it is boring but you have minimal actual tactical control. I do feel like it gives you useful information and you have a direct investment in yours hip designs. This is fun.
- The tech tree. The way the tech tree is done it is not overwhelming, and this is really nice. You randomly get 3 choices for each of 3 technology typse so you never know what you will research this time.			"

281990,76561198088967652,4,6,0,True,52.0,May 23,"I am a huge fan of RTS games. I love many types of strategy games. Of all the Strategy games I habe played I would put this in the top of my list for sure. I have only been able to log in 52 hours into the game, yet I still have only scratched the surface. This game to me is a great blend of two of my favorite Strategy games. Total War and Civ. 
I like how the economy is set up in the game. I think it has a good balance. What I mean by good balance is that it is not incredibly easy to have a surplus of materials, while in the same sense it is not terribly hard either. By adding the rare materials that give you a great boost in your economy was a good idea. It also adds a reason to fight over certain solar systems as well. It keeps you from just sitting back and racking up resources until late game. 
The amount of content the game has is really compelling as well. There are tons of different technologies you can learn to better you planets, you defenses, your military, etc. Also there are a ton of different races and traits to choose from. 
The ability to customize your own civilization is fantastic. The traits keep you balanced as well. By not allowing you to do certain things within your own goverment makes it a little more difficult when conquering other civs.
Those are a few of the reasons I think this is a great game. The only con that I personally would like to be changed is the combat. I dont feel too involved in the combat. It doesnt capture my attention. I like to be more involved in my battles like I am in Total War. I do understand not every game and its combat will be like Total War and that is fine. I would just like to be a little more involved then just click a whole fleet and watching them fight a different fleet. Maybe that could be supplemented by adding the ability to control the armies that invade planets. 
Overall I think this game was worth every penny and any fan of RTS/Strategy games should play this. It is alot of fun.			"
281990,76561198075840195,4,6,0,True,19.4,May 21,"OK so I have roughly about 15 hours into this game and here's what I would consider an honest review.
I should also mention that ive not played any other paradox games, so I think IM coming into this game with a fresh perspective
2 of those hours are spent in creating my race ( still waiting on a star wars mod haha)
I found the initial start of the game a tiny bit confusing, but the tutorial quickly gets rid of any confusion.
After that it is a classic management game set in an amazing sci fi universe. 
So once I figured out what I was doing an all the menus , I quickly set out to take over a small universe (150 stars) .. As I said im new to this game 
I went with a standard race type and started settling the new words slowly but surely. Had a good mineral store and energy credit store, also had what I thought was a good size fleet ( I was wrong) .. After a few hours of gameplay and meeting a cpl of other races. I decided to tackle a battle ........ Suffice to say I was rick rolled on my first battle .. 
I was at war ..... They came after my systems and went through them like butter LOL ..... I didn't mind this as was fun to watch 
after all this I sat back reviewed what had happened .... I started a new game and went a bit more slowly LOL 
so 10/10 for awesome gamplay .. Sounds effects .. And pretty much everything !!
The only con I have is ... I wish the tutorials for later game mechanics were a little bit more in depth .. But anyone with a working 4k game knowledge will get through this 
Definitely recommend this game .... Someone please hurry up with a star wars mod please !!			"
281990,daedaloth,4,6,0,True,42.5,May 21,"A good start for a 4x-space game franchise. The midgame is pretty bad though, which is surprising considering the strengths of the Clausewitz engine as exemplified in EUIV for instance. The problem is that it doesn't transition well from early to mid game, and mid game takes time to develop. Even when it is developed the weaknesses in current Diplomacy is hard to ignore which makes you lose interest.
I might seem harsh, but looking at the other games in the market Stellaris still has a bit to go. Right now I still consider Endless Space the best 4x-space game is Endless Space. 
But there is a future for Stellaris as Paradox are known for the quality and improvements they put into their games post release and with their DLC. Therefore I think this game might be really good in a year or two. But until then, I recommend staying with Endless Space.			"
281990,Sorenzo,4,6,0,True,392.7,May 21,"I was *very* wary of buying this game. I think a lot of 4X games turn out to be bland, and space 4X games have turned out to be total flops in the past.
But I wound up buying it. To be quite honest, the fact that Paradox has acknowledged the game's shortfalls on their forums made me much more comfortable buying it, since it gives me faith that, if I end up with the same criticism as many others have, Paradox will address them.
That said, here's my concerns:
- The diplomacy system could use more work, compared to EU4 and CK2. However, I do think it meets the standard expectations, and it's significantly better than certain other 4X games, like Civ5 and <insert that crappy 4X space game I can't bother looking up. Samurai space bears come to mind.>.
- I've been surprised that alien empires aren't as aggressive as I imagined from a Paradox game, although I suspect that that's by intention - why start galactic wars if there are still colonizable planets? However, if the AI doesn't start to try and kill me at some point, I'll edit this review to say that the game is unplayable.
- No orbital mechanics. I realize the engine they've designed is very functional and spartan, and the game looks good for the most part, but damnit, I PLAYED KSP AND I LIKE ORBITAL MECHANICS.
- There ought to be a more significant difference between ocean, arctic, and desert worlds. 
- Minor graphic realism qualms - the galaxy could look more... galaxy-scaled. The background could probably be more realistic. And should the stellar dust be so... dust-looking?
- Minor interface qualms.
- At this point in my game, I am not convinced that the populations are important enough. It doesn't seem to matter what they believe, and the only racial trait that seems important is their planet preference.
- The ship design system could be more rewarding and involved, although it's really not bad. The combat is a bit too rock-paper-scissors, and could use more options.
- Some of the tech names/descriptions could be more realistic. 
What I like about this game: 
- Unlike many 4X and especially 4X space games, Stellaris seems to have really good pacing and doesn't push too much micromanagement on the player. You generally have something to do, but you don't have to manually control a million planets and constantly organize your fleets - although Paradox should allow us to set planets and fleets as rally points.
- It's not turn-based. Trust me, that's a big improvement. 
- Many of the things you will discover are surprisingly interesting.
- Randomized races. I don't have to make them. There's more than the standard few. They're a lot more varied and interesting than I expected. 
I guess all of this doesn't sound like a huge recommendation, so I'll sum it up:
- Stellaris is the best 4X space game since Sword of the Stars 1. It's like all the other ones, but a lot better, as far as I can tell. I'll be sure to update this if I change my mind.			"

Thankfully Paradox appears to be addressing many of those flaws in the next patch due the end of May and 2 more patches after that. Biggest problem currently is the midgame is dreadfully slow moving. This is due to them releasing without the midgame events that were supposed to happen.
So while the game is in a state that I would consider ""unfinished"" it has a solid core and patches in the pipe. Additionally, it is extremely moddable and I expect good things to come due to the mods.
If you like Grand Strategy games then this should be in your library.			"
281990,gaiusbertus,4,6,0,False,48.4,May 22,"A few months and some patches and DLC later, this game will probably be a 4X game nearly as good as MoO2. But for now, it is dreadfully shallow. It starts great however: race customization is fun, early exploration is exciting, not in the least because of some good writing for some event chains. The game looks good, the soundtrack is also a great, somewhere in between Mass Effect 1 and Interstellar. But as mentioned in many other reviews, both of users and journalists: once you hit mid-game, the stream of nice events dries up and what's left is a grand strategy-light with braindead AI.
Luckily, Paradox promised to fix most of the stuff, like the wonky AI, in patches soon to come, so there remains hope. And there is also hoping they will add lots of stuff in DLCs and free updates, for example""
- Intrigue, espionage and diplomatic missions, both inside other empires and inside your own realm
- A (civilian) trade mechanism which you can influence, pirate of blockade (a la Civ5 perhaps)
- More uniqueness between the (randomized) races, factions and empires, because now the differences are mainly superficial.
- More Science Fiction tropes: where are the doomsday weapons, the artifical planets, the living ships, the race to post-humanism, cybernetics, temporal technologies, cloaking and stealth ships, space trees, alien diseases, etc etc.
- Fleshed-out characters with motivations which may not always align with your own, somewhat like CK2
- Faction-play inside your empire that becomes way more important, especially mid-game

281990,76561197961277512,4,6,0,False,18.7,May 17,"The early game exploration + expansion is decent, though has a lot of room for improvement. The mid game is a grind that slows down more and more as the game drags on. Actually capturing enemy planets or making another empire a vassal takes a very long time. Why? Because often you will declare war with an empire who has allies and end up having to defeat ~30% of 5 empires just to be rewarded with 2 planets... in a galaxy with a few thousand planets. There is no other victory condition other than combat that I'm aware of either. 
The UI is less than mediocre  and is apparently going to be a main focus of the first patch due out at the end of May. There are no waypoints for shipyards, which is something pretty basic, and some midgame tasks are made incredibly tedious by the lack of UI elements such as ""show me planets in my borders with untapped resources"" or earlygame things such as ""show me a list of all habitable planets."" In general having sortable lists is a good thing and there's not much of that here yet. 
There is potential here. The general slow-paced RTS with large scope idea works, but it's just really rough right now and 90% of the fun is in the first few hours of the game. 
This might be a very good game in a year's time, but in its current state I'd recommend waiting for the sales.			"

281990,Krispehh,4,6,0,True,38.6,May 16,"Great game by Paradox that really mixes classic 4X strategy with more forgiving 'Paradox-esque"" traits from Crusader Kings II and Europ Universalis.
I've yet to reach a point where nothing is either impossible nor a pushover. No matter how big you grow there's almost always someoone (or multiple) who can put you back into your place if you get greedy. The reverse being true when theres always a way to claw your way back into the game either through diplomacy or shrewd tactics.
The ethics system is honestly one of the greatest mechanics in any 4X game I've played to date. Each individual pop will have it's own traits, preferences and ethics that may vary differently from their neighbours. Depending on your actions factions of individualists may rise up to combat your attempts to silence individuality. Or maybe your pacifist citizens are tired of your militaristic ways and decide to stand up for their own beliefs. It's a nice addition as it feels that each race and pop has it's own agenda rather than being another number to pay taxes or join your military.
The introduction of a semi-RNG tech system is also an amazing new spin on traditional strategy games. While still partially present in the background linear tech-trees and best practice are things of the past. Sure you maybe be able to rush to Artic colonisation so improving habitatibility now might seem a great idea - and then the card might not appear for 30 years. While I'm sure this might agitate some players it does add the complexity other 4X research lacks. Rather than being commited to unlocking techs one after another they're presented almost as scientific breakthroughs you won't neccesarily expect. In my current playthrough the sudden arrival of a clone army tech was awesome as I had no idea that was even a thing - and in my pacifist, xenophile republic based off of the Star Wars Galactic Republic it was a space geek dream.
The combat is simple and may lack some of the mincromanaging skills of other 4X games but lets be honest - it's a Paradox game we never expected that in the first place. Instead it's more about taking th opportunity to strike when it arises - maybe your enemy was drawn into another war or is facing domestic rebellion. Maybe you just unlocked a new tech (hell yeah Advanced Strike Craft) that they have no means to combat. Combat is all about understanding your opponents fleets and building to exploit their flaws while also minimising your own.
Of worthy note is the movement system. It's great to see access to wormhole, hyperspace and warp as seperate categories of space travel. It adds more variety to engagement and minimalises the chokehold effect other 4X games may emply. Sure you can build a massive defense station at the chokehold of the hyperspace way - that won't stop warp drives simply bypassing the system. It's nice to force players to think more critically of their decisions and encourage unorthodox gameplay.
All in all despite some of the minor issues and lacking capabilities in the game currently it's well worth the price for a game you'll gladly sink hours into. Knowing Paradox the game will recieve support, continual bugfixes and about a million expansions (all of which I'll gladly buy) that will result in one truly amazing game.

281990,MagusSartori,4,6,0,True,88.1,May 20,"The most important things:
Is Stellaris fun? Yes.
I like 4X games, should I buy it? Yes.
I haven’t played many 4X games, should I buy it? Probably not.
Ok, now lets begin. 
This is a review by and for someone who has a lot of hours logged in 4X games. If you don't already like 4X games or know what I mean by 4X, then Stellaris is possibly not for you and there are better entry points to the genera. I suggest starting with the Civilization series before coming back. As a 4X game Stellaris is a mixed bag. It adds some things to the genera, but it also flat fails on some things the genera mastered a long time ago.
The Good:
What Stellaris does well is Tone, Theme, and Story(s). An area where this genera far far too frequently just phones it in. This is where Stellaris shines. Leaders and Ethics add a great deal of imaginary frosting to the everyday tasks of expanding your space empire. The event chains and the stories they tell were entertaining. The late-game crises and fallen empires were genuinely terrifying when they first popped up. It was a very refreshing experience, and I hope future 4X games step up to this challenge.
Mechanically I like the sector system, but want to see it more limited (like restricting a sector to the same planet limit as your core worlds). I like the random tech system. The basic game mechanics are nothing to write home about, but acceptable. There are some balance issues, but there will be patches.
The Bad:
While Stellaris does well with Tone, Theme, and Story, where it fails is that the vast majority of these things have only a token impact on the game mechanics. So you’ve chosen to be a militant atheist and your neighbor is a religious zealot. They hate you. Thematically great. Mechanically they were going to hate you anyway because you decided that you wanted some of your other neighbors stuff, because that’s the only reasonable way to expand. Everyone always hates you.
I love the leadership system for the fun little game of managing my cohort of cronies. Mechanically the bonuses they provide are only OK. And excepting survey vessels, if you don’t hire a leader for the entire game, nothing bad will happen.
And finally, the game is slow. Very slow. I’m that type of guy that built a custom map in Sins of a Solar Empire with 5 max size galaxies. I don’t mind a grind so long as i’m having fun, but Stellaris is REALLY a grind. I have something like 40 hours in Stellaris at this point and all that is all ONE GAME. And I’ve only got only perhaps 1/5 of the galaxy under my control and some fallen neighbors who could totally steamroller me. Not even close to winning yet.
The Ugly:
The interface and visual design (no joke intended) commit some major faux pas for a game of this genera. Notably by making you scroll through your overlay rather than keeping information nice and compact, clutter up icons in the play field, and have no reasonable find or filter functions. 4X games are in no small part information management games because there are so many things going on in them. And while the interface is well suited to an early game, by even the middle of the game i’m finding myself spending way too much time paused and scanning the screen for an icon or scrolling through a list of 40 items where the window only displays 3 or 4 at once. The interface looks great, but it simply is not good enough for a 4X management game. That the interface needs to be tight is something other 4X titles learned and mastered a long time ago. And this is my biggest gripe because it’s the itch that never goes away, and only gets worse over time.
Overall I’m enjoying the game, but will be looking for mods to help alleviate what problems I came across. At this point it is not going on my best games list, but there are definitely some sweet things I want future 4X games to take away from Stellaris.			"
281990,76561198049840096,4,6,0,True,17.0,May 27,"I'm a Paradox man through and through. I have spent a lot of time on their games and enjoyed them well enough. Stellaris is the newest addition in the Paradox family, but it seems like it's the geeky little brother that doesn't compare to his siblings. Stellaris is great, and fun, and interesting. It has a great concept, and fun play style, and a lot of customization. Yet however great it is it cannot compare to CK2, or EUIV for that matter.
I don't have much time on the game, because it has a serious problem: an awful midgame. Don't get me wrong, the first two hours you put into a campaign is amazing, watching yourself, and eventually other fledgling empires, grow into something greater. Yet after all that, after expanding to the reaches, you find yourself sitting waiting for new tech that comes in 56 months that you need to expand more. So you sit, and you wait, hovering around the galaxy and opening up every tab a hundred times until something happens. Now that's not to say that there's nothing to do, but sending your science ship to explore various systems is taxing on my patience as I wait for him to find out that there's one power in the distant solar system on the edge of the universe. 
As far as in depth warfare goes, I find myself fighting two types of wars: one where the enemy has no chance because they are ""pathetic"" or where I have no chance because my equally sized neighbor has two thousand more power strength than my massive fleet. I either am wrecked or wrecking, but whichever way it is I am alone. No faction ever wants to ally me because, although they have 150 like for me, they have a slightly different policy system and don't think we need to band together in the even of that massive empire decides he wants to conquer us. Playing solo is more a handicap than fun, unlike CK2 might I add, yet I haven't had the pleasure to experience it in mutliplayer which I guarentee will enhance the game. Because in MP, even in a lull with mid-gameplay I'll have a friend to fight wars with me or to make fun of those weiner shaped repitilian people.
Now you might be wondering, after all my complaints, why I gave this a positve review. And the answer to that is, whatever the shortcomings of this game in early release, I still very much enjoy it, and know that paradox takes some time to turn something good into great. Already though there is a plethora of customization options, a massive changing universe, an innumerable amount of undeveloped nations and adversaries to laugh at. So this game will remain good, and then become great, until they release Conclave-Stellaris which will render the game awful. But that won't happen until a few years from now, so I still have time to enjoy the game.
Side note: Paradox will be releasing FREE enhancements for the game for these first few months, before they release massive content DLC. So we'll get a great and more developed game before we start buying $15 packs to get the Spider Races and Interstellar Orcs.			"

On the 1000 star map after some time, things were barely progressing anymore. This is due to the lack of real diplomacy, sector management, or fleet options. The AI players don't seem like other people at all. They are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 
Then the game started moving really, really slowly during each fight, probably due to bad design decisions. I would guess every rocket is modelled in order to hit the right target, in fleets with hundreds of ships. This also explains the lame 1000 fleet max size cap. While modelling every rocket exactly sounds like a fun idea, in the end you don't gain anything from it, but the game becomes very hardware demanding.
I still was going to win the game, but now I encountered a game breaking bug. The game freezes for about one second, once per day change... a day change happens about once per second. This was not happening before I exited and reloaded the game, so it is the same situation in game that was working ok before.
If you google for this bug, you find lots of threads, some closed by moderators from two months ago, which say that this is already known and about to be fixed. I now also tried to opt into the beta patch in order to try to fix the problem. No improvement.

There are not enough chances of development in mid and late-game, after the first few hours the entire thing becomes quite boring and repetitive.

However, the 40 or so hours I've spent on the game so far has been in one game. I started as the ""Solarian Star Republic"" which was a militaristic, xenophilic human government with a personal mandate to have the most powerful fleet in the galaxy. After a few pre-emptive strikes on a former ally (I swear they were going to attack me!), they'd been absorbed and I sat as the 10th largest in terms of volume of space, while my military was 3rd in the galaxy. Not only that but I'd formed a Federation which was the most powerful alliance of star nations in the galaxy. Following that, there was a bit of friction with a fallen empire and I, again, pre-emtpively struck them with a force three times more powerful than anything they had (plust the allies who decided to help out). After absorbing the fallen empire after the shortest war in the history of the galaxy, I looked over my new domain of space and began aggressive colonisation of my newly found paradise. Finally having a chance to breathe, I looked over the Solarian League (I renamed it) and realised that, although I'd acted in terms of non-expansionist policy (I'd aimed to destroy my threat, not expand my territory), not ONCE had I been on the defencive. Now, my empire was the 2nd largest by volume and, by far, the most powerful military and, I'm guessing, the most powerful economy (thank you Fallen Empire).
If you couldn't be bothered to read all that, I'll summarise my point quickly. This game lets you play how you want, at whatever speed you want, for as long as you want. There aren't many games that do THAT right.
I just wish they'd release the damn soundtrack!!!			"
281990,reasonableman,4,6,0,False,34.4,June 29,"Stellaris serves two masters, in that it is both an introduction to 4X and grand strategy games, and a game from Paradox, known for the insane depth of games like Crusader Kings. This means that it isn't especially pleasing to either party; some of the late-game strategizing isn't as good as it should be, with clunky mechanics making it difficult to manage large empires, but not in terms of gameplay, only in terms of interface. Some of the early game strategizing is difficult to parse, with some obscure mechanics in warfare and economic mangement. Some things are tedious for no apparent reason, and the pool of possible anomalies is depressingly small compared to the possible scale of the galaxy. Combat is shallow, but initially confusing, which seems to be the theme in this game; there's enormous potential (and some great music), and I simply can't tell you to buy it at the moment. Perhaps someday.			"

I realize it's a grand strategy game and not a war game, but winning wars is tedious to say the least.  In the current build, the path to victory is pump out all the corvettes you can support and swarm the enemy fleet.  That's what they're going to go ahead and do.  Anything larger is really a waste.
As far as the game in general, it's slow.  REALLY slow.  If you've ever played a Paradox style game before, I guess you'll like this.  I do not.  You'll wait many long minutes for something, ANYTHING, to happen.  There's a building for minerals, one for energy, and one for science.  There's some unique buildings thrown in the mix but overall, that's it.  Pretty dull and repetitive to me.

That being said, if that you then Stellaris may not be a good game for you. If you have never played or didnt like games like civilization, masters of orion, sins of a solar empire, galactic civilizations, etc. than you may not appreciate this game. If you do like those games, this is much like those but better in some respects. To me, after playing for 137.4 hours and having played all these types of games for 20+ years, this game just has a sense of character that I really appreciate. Its still rough around the edges, yes, but I firmly believe Paradox will iron all that out and improve on what they have wrought. It is unrealistic to expect a complete game anymore in this day and age. Some may argue thats unfair, and I may agree, but its still the truth. I\'m just happy its playable and fun. Again, 137.4 hours. And its running right now in my background (I LOVE the music). If you are on the fence about this game, wait till it gets a bit cheaper and some stuff gets ironed out then give it a try. The mods make it great too. 
Little tidbit.. my last game I came across Earth, and it was during the early 20th century so they were on the brink of nuclear war. I had the choice of just observing the humans (gaining some tech points) or I could infiltrate them and take over the planet, or I could uplift them and make them a separate spacefaring alien race in the game who would be my vassals. I chose that, and after they became my vassal I decided to release them to be an independant AI empire. About 50 years later, I researched Sentient AI. This is a dangerous tech, because it can lead to an AI uprising (think, the Matrix meets Terminator). Well, the Terran Conferacy was pissseddd... They formed a federation with 4 other empires and went to war with me. I won.. but then the AI DID uprise and conquered Earth and a few others that I won in the war.. so.. I basically started the Matrix/Terminator on Earth after I uplifted humans to the level of Star Trek. THAT was worth every cent I paid...			"
281990,Yazilliclick,5,8,0,False,104.8,May 22,"I'd love to recommend this game right now but unfortunately the lack of polish and content in the mid to end game just doesn't allow that.  I will say it's a great base for a game and if Paradox supports the game with updates like they say they plan to then it very well has the potentially to one of, if not THE, best 4x space strategy game out there.
Summary of thoughts (tl;dr):Positives
Graphics are nice throughout and consistent.  They flow well together.  Animates portraits for races are very nice.
Early game exploration, questing and constructing keeps you busy during what is usually a very boring part of a 4x game
Empire construction provides a good number of different options which seem decently balanced 
Negatives
Nothing happens from mid game all the way to the end unless you go out and make it.  Even then it can be slow.
Lacking information feedback to the player.  This is very puzzling coming from Paradox but the information screens in game are very limited in number and detail and the few that exist are hard to use (no sorting or filtering of lists)
There are clearly bugs and unfinished aspects to major game mechanics like sectors and diplomacy 
Game tends to slow down and lock up in end game
Lengthy Explanation
So I'll go through the game in order but first off I'd like to say at the time of writing this I've played the early game with 3 different civs.  Created about 5 civs and played 1 game until end game.  The one I played until end game was playing basically the Federation from Star Trek so was mostly peaceful unless attacked and such.  I've got all the achievements for the game pretty much other than bugged ones and end game ones.
Empire creation is nice.  There are good options and I really like the look of the animated portraits for the races.  They really provided a great number of options too which is wonderful.  They also provide a lot of options for banner symbols (though a few more background options and color choices would be appreciated, already mods out for these though).  They also provide some good choices for racial traits.  All in all it's a nice process with good options.
Early game is probably the most fun I've had in a 4x game mostly due to the science ship questing and surveying.  Now I could see this aspect getting stale after playing it numerous times but I'm not there yet.  Usually in a 4x game the early game tends to be a lot of hitting end turn, maybe moving one unit and generally just waiting for things to build up.  Here you tend to be juggling about 5 units from the start to survey and research, build mining and research posts and your fleet to clear out hostile aien space creatures.  Combine all that with the usual space 4x jobs of managing planet tiles, colonization and research and it does a great job of keeping you busy.
Mid game it feels like the game is done.  The exact problem other 4x games have in early game this game has in mid and late game; nothing happens, you just wait around for something to come along.  Now as stated before I was playing a peaceful cooperative sort of species so this someone led into this.  Once you have an alliance or federation and you've explored the planets you can up to the borders of those sueround you then the AI just sits back too.  Nobody declares war, there are no big events mid game to keep you busy, there's really nothing at all happening.  Now if you were playing a war civ then  maybe you could keep busy with declaring war but that can only be so exciting if the AI never initiates anything themselves.
End game can have some events to spice things up but they are very late and can miss entirely.  In my game I've had the unbiden spawn on the other side of the galaxy in the middle of the 2nd largest civ.  Due to diplomacy bug I can't get military access from them so I have no way to go after the unbiden.  The Unbiden are also growing very very slowly.  So them spawning has basically brought nothing to the game for me because my only options are to declare war against another civ which makes no sense for my empire or ditch my allies and join their alliance just to get access.  I've also been working on trying to tick off a fallen empire by researching sentient AIs but they refuse to declare war on me even though I've refused their demands and was sitting at like -400 or -500 relations.  My AI also hasn't rebelled yet though I've populated a couple planets with them.  
So basically since early mid game I've had two very minor wars and other than that for the last 8 hours of play or something ridiculous (hard to estimate, I leave the game running at times) I've been doing nothing but upgrading buildings, colonizing planets as I research unlocks for new planets and otherwise just twiddling my thumbs.  It's been boring.  For the last 3 hours before quiting my campaign I've found myself watching movies with the game running in the background and just alt+tabbing to it when a notice sounds that research complete or a leader died grabs my attention.
The game also has a lot of bugs/unifinished aspects.  I've not had as bad of sector AI as some seem to have, mine build up tiles pretty well as long as I keep them supplied with resources.  They aren't perfect though and they really are lacking in dealing with slight out of the ordinary situations like robotic populations (they keep building farms for food that isn't needed).  The real annoying bug though is the regular locking up/freezing of the game since late mid game.  Basically the UI is still responsive but the game will basically pause and not respond for about 10 seconds every few minutes or so.
I think the problems are fixable and they've acknowledge some and pledged to work on them so fingers are crossed here.  But right now the game just isn't fun when it needs to be so can't recommend people buy.			"

Playtime: Endless
ReviewLet’s start with an immediate confession… I am a crappy Grand Strategy player. I tend to get overwhelmed by certain factors, and spend too much time focusing on certain aspect and forget others which are equally important.
Stellaris on the other hand was a completely different experience for me. I was playing a Grand Strategy game where I was able to cope with different features. This was probably thanks to the way the game has been designed and partitioned and also thanks to the rock solid tutorial that took me by the hand and asked me to tackle a number of issues before attempting to be an almighty conqueror. Also the fact that I started small, with one core planet allowed me to cope when compared to taking a country with 30 different provinces.
As mentioned before you start the game on your Home Planet, in your Home Solar System with a small fleet, a level 1 Spaceport, a Science Ship and a Construction Ship. On the get go the game gives you all the starting tools necessary to take over the Galaxy. Your Home Planet is divided into Surfaces where you can construct Buildings to increase 2 of your main resources (Energy and Minerals), increase your Food Output for the planet, which regulates how much you Pops grow or increase Science resources. The other main resources that you do not conventionally generate is Influence, which is needed to grow your empire and recruit leaders.
Science ships are used to discover the galaxy and Construction Ship are there to fill the discovered areas with Outpost. Gradually you will create a Colony Ship and you Empire will grow slowly. The game is filled with random events to keep you interested, until you start meeting with other species and a Diplomacy starts to take importance. You can try to be friends with everyone or conquer everyone, it is your choice. 
And that still is not all, there are still so many features I could talk about but the premise of this write up is a review and not a strategy guide. The game is feature rich enough to keep you going for at least 20 hours without the kinks start showing in the game. And yes, the game is not perfect and has some minor problems and inconveniences. For a number of tasks, automation seems necessary, one example being that it is a chore to get to survey all of the systems in the game, and even after queue, one Evasion destroys that queue and with so much stuff happen one could easily miss that one of the Ships has stopped working. Another problem is that the mid-game can sometimes be a lull, and you just wait there for something to happen.
Despite the concerns, Paradox till today have already released one Update and 3 bug fixes, and it shows they are working hard to fill in the empty spots and fix the leaks. I am confident that after sometime Stellaris will be one of best the 4X Games available.

281990,jaakaappi,5,8,0,False,23.7,May 20,"Good: 
The building system, random stories, Zerg invasion and hyperspace masterrace. A lot of character. 
Bad: 
Lacks content, even with customizable ships (which don't seem so attracting if you have a simple toggle that autogenerates the best (in what?) combination for you) and races. 
Techs quit bringing anything new after a while and become just upgrades to weapon damage, buildings etc. 
The fact that you can't really select what you research because the options are random leads to situations where you can be wholly under- or overpowered compared to your neighbours or just simply stuck with not being able to nothing because you only have corvettes with level 5 autocannons or something similar.
AI is terrible in waging war, both against and with you, sending single corvettes against you as an enemy or following you with a huge blob of a fleet without actually intelligently engaging anything as an ally. If you were to get destroyed the fleet will disperse to guard the AI's space.
Waging war is also difficult due to the fact that enemy ships can quite freely pass through your territory and if you don't have any sensors you can't see them before they are hacking your home world to pieces.
Graphics lag if you raise the match speed, battles are ♥♥♥♥♥torms that could be dealt with in an orderly manned instead of ramming two swarm AI's into each other and consuming what little juice your computer has left. That is, graphical displays of battle are non-informative, useless and look like a group of nails shooting GPU-expensive fireworks at each other.
Sectors suck as you can't really utilize them to their fullest. They either produce one of the three resource types at max. 75% or concentrate in walling themselves in. The game has a pause button so you can micromanage. You don't need systems that take that away, just systems that make it easier. Like the empire overview or whatever it is that lists your planets.
Not as diplomaticly deep as EUIV. You give the enemy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of minerals and exotic resources and it'll love you for the rest of your game. No spying, no plotting. AI only insults if you insult it first, after which it plays like a child that learned a new thing in school. A lot like Civ V actually, without Gandhi the Nuclear Doombringer.
Races are difficult to distinguish in galaxy view because they can have same colors. Also in EUIV it's much easier to know which countries the game means and thus where they are (e.g. when it says Austria attacked Germany) than in Stellaris (Tzunn attacked something else inconceivable).
Sometimes you can't see your friend's server in the server list.
Steam integration is broken (no joining or inviting)
You can't give orders to fleets when they are warping.

281990,76561198095585943,5,8,0,True,145.8,June 5,"I read some of the other reviews and the main criticism seems to center around 2 issues. 
The first being that the game feels and plays a bit rough and seems incomplete. To that I say, give it a month or two, the updates that have come out have already dramatically improved the game, and the quality of the game itself more than makes up for it. Also, these complaints if stacked up against almost any other ""incomplete"" game on steam don't really hold water. Go play one of the survival alphas that cost 30 bucks and are so buggy you'd be lucky to successfully do what the devs demonstrated in the trailer, or play whatever new steaming pile of excrement slurped out of treyarch this week for console and come back and talk about how complete stellaris is.
The second big complaint is that mid-late game play is redundant, boring, and or lacking content. Well, to some extent I'd have to agree with that criticism, but at the same time I'd say this is the exact same complaint you might level at ck2 or eu4. Everyone who's played eu4 extensively knows of that moment when your empire is so strong that the game becomes easy and you can just bulldoze through entire continents. Stellaris operates much in the same way, so it has many of the same pit falls in terms of playability you encounter in eu4.
If you're willing to overlook a bit of early bugginess, and so far a slight lacking in content and you want to play an intricate sci fi empire game with an almost tedious amount of detail this is for you. If you're maybe possibly not entirely sure that genocide is a bad idea and want to murder all of the other species/people you encounter, this game is for you. If you like eu4 and eu4 in space is what you pray to Gaben for every night before you go to bed, well, it has arrived.			"

281990,76561198023210867,5,8,0,False,212.3,May 19,"It is hard to not expect too much from a game by a studio that has created such wonderful time-consumers as Hoi3, EU4 and Crusader Kings 2, and it is hard to not be too unfair in the face of such disappointment. But this game just isn’t ready yet.
There are several new and original ideas, like edics (political decision) and factions (political organizations of discontent citizens), individual ethics (political preferences of each single population) and fun government types, like you would expect from paradox’ rich and fruitful strategy experience. But the fact that any cool empire management feature (edicts, allicances, planetary programs, border expansion, faction management, government decisions, leaders and governors, even certain buildings and moving population around) requires “influence”, by far the most valuable resource, effectively takes all of this out of the game, since you are always trying to save your points and do without.
Sound and graphics are from 10-15 years ago, surely not as important in a strategy game, but in this case made so lackluster and dull, it hurts the gaming experience. At least an animated landing of a colony ship should have made it into the budget. What you get is a stamp-size picture with the graphics quality of a steam achievement. 
The menu is intricate and counterintuitive. You have a colony ship and want to see a list of possible planets? Not possible. You are on the star chart and want to click on your colony directly? Not possible. You are on a planet and want to switch though to the next? Not possible. You always have to click all the way up, all the way down. To put something on a building list requires all the resources immediately, which you can never afford. So no building lists either. Click, click, click. The game should come with an extra mouse, for wear and tear reasons.
The entire gaming experience feels like an Early Access. There are just so many things that remain unfinished and incomplete, it seems that the developers have first and foremost spent their creativity on one question: what else of the things you would normally expect from a 4x space game (and that was already there as early as Master of Orion 2) can we take out of the game to later sell it to the players as DLC?
 Victory conditions? 	YES, take it out!
 Tactical Battles?		YES, take it out!
 Diversified troops? 		YES, take it out!

In short, great 4x game, but not the grand strategy I was hoping for from Paradox.
On my 5th game, First 3 I gave up after 10-50 years just learning the basics. 4th game I won a domination victory on Iron man normal (600 star Galaxy). By the end I noticed that everything I was seeing I had seen several times before. Now on my 5th game on same settings with a different race I am seeing all the same things again. The game plays perfectly, but there just doesn't seem to be the variety that I had hoped for. I will keep at it for a while to see if this is definitely the case, but at 61 hours in, i don't think there is enough to this game (I had high expectations). I end up with the same sorts of ships (quite limited to designs really), same random events popping up, same issues with close neighbours.

281990,76561197991803929,5,8,0,True,30.2,May 15,"This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review, so apologies in advance if I ramble.
Firstly, let me say that Stellaris is a *wonderful* game with scads of potential. 
But if you're buying Stellaris expecting “EU4-In-Spaaaaaace”, then I would advise caution. 
Stellaris is its own game. Not simply a re-skin. There are some recognizable UI elements and Paradox Grand Strategy tropes, but that's it. Many things are handled differently: resources, vassals, armies (in both creation and customization), and research - just to name a few. 
However, as I mentioned above, the operative word is potential. It’s not there yet. Stellaris has a long way to go before it’s on the same level as EU4 or CK2. I don't mean in terms of story or setting, I mean in terms of gameplay and UI.
There is a surprising lack of map modes for a Grand Strategy game. Not having a way to easily see who’s allied to whom, or who you are sucking up to, is particularly missed. The trade map mode is missing as well, but then again, so is trade. In this way Stellaris reminds me more of Civilization. No managing trade nodes. No way to steer trade or use your mercantile strength in your favor, it simply happens via trade deals with other empires. No sneaky-sneaking either. Intrigue is non-existent against other space faring races (though you can infiltrate pre-space age peoples and supplant their government with your own).
Those are just some of the issues I’ve run across in 20-or-so hours. Now, I have no doubt that Paradox will positively inundate Stellaris with DLC content to flesh it out. But that's the rub. If you’ve ever played a Sims game at launch you’ll know the feeling. ""You gave me pools last time EA... where are they now? Seriously? Five lamps and a wall sconce?"" Except here I was asking for deeper trade, easier ways to access information, more options to flex my diplomatic muscles, a more succinct and intuitive UI - in short, a greater range of ways to conquer the galaxy. I know you can do it Paradox! You've done it before! 
Doesn’t paint a pretty picture does it? So why would I recommend Stellaris? 
Because even with its flaws. It's good. Really good. And it will only get better. 
There are too many positives to list. There’s creativity here; quality too. This wasn’t half-♥♥♥♥♥, but it needs some polish. That shouldn't be a big surprise really. This is a big departure from what Paradox normally puts out, Stellaris needs time to acclimate, room to figure out what works and what doesn't. If Paradox’s track record is any indication – it will get there in time. Just temper your expectations for now.

It's a very rough release, with numerous subtle bugs and features that just dont work at all. It's also very, very bare bones, clearly designed as a framework for loads and loads of DLC. If you want the game it'd probably be best to wait a year or two for Stellaris: Complete Edition on sale.
If the thought of the hundreds of dollars in DLC that is coming that will flesh the game out and fix and improve it doesnt bother you, it's pretty fun as long as you dont expect too much from it.
The devs have layed out some plans for the future in patches, but it sounds like it's all going to be mostly focused on patching and tweaking the base game into a fully functional and stable state (which is very much needed) and any actual new content will almost certainly be paid.
Getting pretty salty about stripped down, rushed games with avalanches of overpriced DLC.

The issues with Stellaris are far outweighed by the positives. It's an engaging game and the AI, contrary to what I've seen suggested by some, is not that bad at all on the higher difficulties ---- although it would be nice if allied fleets were better distributed, instead of all of them just following one of your own fleets. Like all strategy games it could use a slightly more realistic diplomacy, needs more tradeable commodities and better sector management --- all easy fixes though I doubt diplomacy will be improved, bad (or should I say questionable) diplomacy just seems to be a constant for almost all strategy games. 
If I were to compare Stellaris to the Civ games in terms of development at release, I would suggest vanilla Stellaris is much more advanced and that bodes well for the future. I highly recommend the game for strategy enthusiasts.			"

Several Key problems
-Ai is broken, during war they follow you around and never attack on their own.
-Very few official trading options, I find trading is very limited and doesn't really play any big part 
-Crisis bug that can be game ending since there is literally no way to official kill the ""scourge"" , you can't take over scourge planets or cleanse them. Soon after they respawn a new army this can be game ending.
-Once again dumb ai that doesn't seem to care about the powerful alien scourge that is devouring the galaxy 
Until the AI is fixed and the bug against the scourge is fixed I cannot suggest this game to anyone that wants to play solo. You will need to mod out the scourge (which as a event i actually liked) and you will need to rely on playing with other people as the AI isn't very exciting. Also very few tradding options makes the game very lack luster (the only thing to do is war and colonize planets), once again mods can add to this but the game is still new and I don't feel I should dig through mods to get a full game. I will most likely update this once new patches come out that hopefully fix the issues i described.

281990,fanaticjam,5,8,0,False,76.3,June 6,"Stellaris is in many ways an addictive, humorous and entertaining 4X game, however many of the design elements clash and I've been left feeling somewhat salty about the entire affair. 
While the AI can cut you down in a single burst and end your campaign with a single fleet at times, it's other mechanics that has left me agitated. There is too much of the dev's trying to make you play the game their way instead of creating a framework for fun. Give the player the option to use automation, or not and let them be responsible for their enjoyment. 
There is no good reason to not allow automation of scouts and building upgrades when you're going to force us to use the frankly terrible sector system (locked automation of sets of planets) that is basically the cancer of the game. 
Much like other 4X games the research system is mostly pointless, deciding which tech comes first is a very minor level of interesting gameplay - I would love to see more real choices, which would contribute to making each playthrough more unique. 
Fleet capacity should not be tied with space stations. Jesus christ. 
The game is also lacking a lot of overlays that you might expect, useful information screens regarding other races - in particular alliances and federations. 
With all that said, the game is far from all bad, and there's lots of humorous elements with the interaction between species and the exploration elements. Wars and war demands are fun and make for a more balanced feel to combat. 
Overall, the game feels like something in beta. and I would recommend waiting to buy. With a bit of luck DLC and patches can fix some of these game breaking gripes. (I'm looking at you, sectors.)			"

- early game feels well balanced has fun events tailored to your civ ideology
- instead of a full tech tree you get a set of random techs you can choose from, making each game different
- ship designer offers a lot of potential (which is wasted since most will use missile or laser corvette spam)
the bad:
ai is among the dumbest of all strategy games I've played
-at war they always try creating a doom stack following you like little puppies
-in alliance they always refuse your war declarations if you dont give them a treat but will blindly accept totally one sided declarations of other ai
- during catastrophe they will watch as they get slaughtered and are more focused on their rivaling neighbours
- by the time a catastrophe happens usually nearly all systems are claimed and you have no other way of preventing it without declaring war to any ai in the way to pass through, very few will allow you military border access for outrageous prices
diplomacy itself is severly lacking:
- alliances/federations are ironclad bounds, ai's will never leave or backstab
- alliances dont even have an option to kick members out
- no system sharing inside an alliance/federation possible while it is possible between independent empires
- war goals feel severly limited and broken
 - only planets can be taken over or liberated, no option to abadon the planet or a whole system
 - whole empires can be vassalized or liberated for 60 war points, which is roughly what 3 planets will cost
With all those shortcomings Stellaris 1.0.3 is a nice to play beta. It will requre a lot more updates and bugfixes from paradox before it will become a good game I could recommend.			"

Everything runs smooth on an Intel i7, GT 750, 16GB, and an SSD, UNTIL mid to late game.  Then there is just stuttering everywhere, its impossible to really do anything.  Add that on top of the fact that the AI for your own navy is just terrible.  Don't let your ships get ""stuck"" between two enemies.  It doesn't know what to do, gets confused, and just sits there.  You can't do anything but retreat which takes a bunch of hitpoints away from your overall health (hull).  Its terrible in the current state.  
Hoping that they fix the issues, because the early game is extremely fun.  However the game was rushed without testing to make a buck, very disappointing.			"

1. AI is bad.
2. Terraforming is disappointing. I really like to terraform things in games for some reason. Terraform a barren planet? Nope. Make a tomb world inhabitable again? Nope, your mighty space empire can't do that.
3. Diplomacy is ridiculous. ""Your mighty militarist space empire with superior fleets and navy capacity offering us pathetic pacifists a non-agression pact? WE WON'T ACCEPT, BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE YOU."" Fine, prepare to be destroyed, you stupid bum-holes.
4. Energy resource is weird. You can't spend it to buy anything. At first you don't have enought of it, but then you have too much and can't spend it in any way.
5. Technology tree isn't great. Getting random tech choices is very meh, I had to wait a ton of time and research bunch of useless techs to get something my empire needs.
6. Micromanagement. In the dev diary they've talked about how you are supposed to feel like an emperor and not a clerk. Nope, still feels like I have to micromanage almost everything.

281990,evilmonk3y,5,8,0,False,17.4,May 22,"For a game like this I really wish there was a way to publish a 'neutral' opinion as Stellaris is just...ok. Which is disappointing from the studio it is coming from and in comparison to Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II.
The game is strongest early on when it is a full on space 4X game, the early exploration phase has some of the best moments a game like this has given me and is easily the most replayable part. There are great events, exciting discoveries and lots of really memorable encounters which set a great base for something to be built on. This early game, the research system, quest chains, planetary & ship development and the soundtrack are probably the great strengths of the game.
Currently, after the early stages the game really takes a nosedive. The transition to mid-game and expansion into the 'Grand Strategy' segments (which are admittedly significantly simplified compared to Paradox's other games) is not smooth. There is suddenly a real lack of things to do apart from conquering your neighbours, there are areas that obviously need to be filled by a espionage system and robust trade. Overall the game turns into a slog to expand your borders where you are constantly having to take the initiative within a mostly static galaxy full of predominantly passive AI that do not help create memorable characters of themselves. 
There are also a number of significant bugs including broken event chains and some features not fully implemented, for example you can have an empire of slaves that will never rebel because that ability is currently turned off for them.
I am somewhat conflicted about Stellaris as I feel that after a few expansions and more time it will improve dramatically but at the moment it is probably not worth it for most people.			"

Early exploration gives a lot of things to do, but the game itself grinds to a halt in the mid to late game where things are very static and repetitive. It's just declare war, steal some planets, repeat. Combat has no strategic depth, causing each war to have a simple battle between massive fleets that compose all of each nation's navy with the larger numbers winning that battle and effectively winning the whole war. When all this is combined with the general lack of features, the game has very litle replayability, and thus I cannot reccomend anyone buy it in its current state.			"

I will say this: the game is fun enough at the start for you to think you made a great buy, and then play it for long enough to pass the return policy timing. You will spend many of these hours being impressed by some of the surface brilliance the game pushes (art work and music is great), and probably learning the various details of the game (like weapon types/enemy types/travel mechanics etc).
Afterwhich, you'll start to think that maybe this wasn't the best buy, because there is a kind of repetitive dryness to the game that I can't quite put my finger on. There isn't much in the way of complex AI, trading, diplomacy, or battle mechanics. It seems like the AI will engage in what is largely the same type of ""camp-then-mass attack"" tactics as a bad TW game.
And in response you will attempt to do basically the same, building enough of what you need (which isn't diverse or complex enough to be sustainably interesting), then attempting to blitz the opposing sectors. And you will rinse and repeat that process until you have, after many dry hours, taken over enough to the galaxy to win.

Enough of that. Stellaris is a exploration and grand strategy game set in space. You can create any species (or use the ones already there) and explore the galaxy. Galaxies can have up to 1000 stars, but you can decrease this number. The game does have some flaws. For example, the sector system doesn\'t give me as much control over planets as I want to have, and the sector governer AI is not the best.

The first time I played this game I said ''Wow!'' because of the complex and customizable races. After many hours played on this game I realize many things.
Is it a good 4X game? Yes it is,
The experience is very nice because you have to lead many things : Explorations, ressources, military, diplomacy, Leaders RP, politicies, planet management, science research and so on. 
Every aspect has traits, score or abilities. The races are infinte combinations like a weird and awful ugly bird but peacefully for example.
It's an amazing and wonderful the strategy game.
Probably the best 4X game I've ever played.
I've got to say BUT. Even with the hundreds of possibility of your empire could have. It has to end wtih war. Be cause the victory conditions is a Big problem in Stellaris to me. And there is no settings in the game for this. Many gamers felt the same thing about it. Paradox have to expand the winning condition and not stick with only domination or elimination conditions.
You could make it your own way of course, but thats why setting exists for the others.
This game has a great potential and they promised updates And DLC will see....

281990,76561197999850159,6,10,0,True,30.7,May 30,Hands down one of the best 4x4 games I'ved played. Simply and easy to pick up but hard to stop playing. Recommended if like space exploration games.			
281990,76561198000103452,6,10,0,True,63.2,May 31,"RIght now, okay-good game. Later, probably, will be great game.
I think the primary issue with this game, beyond solveable ones like optimization and gameplay that are being modifed quite literally as I type this, and that no doubt will be perfected through patches and DLC (as is done in all PDX games), is that it recquires a different type of roleplaying to enjoy.
Most PDX grand strategies require roleplaying to enjoy, but with most of them the framework for the player\'s interaction with the world is easy, as its based in actual history. It is much easier to design a scenario where a character plays as Matilda, Duchess of Tuscany and where the player is able to play that role to their satisfaction, as real life has done much of the setting and characterization for them. This is especially notable in PDX\'s primary market, which would be people with an interest in history. With that in mind, having a goal-less game is easier, as the player is really interacting with a history for amusement, rather than attempting to meet some standard set by the game.
Stellaris is different. There are goals set, yes, but they are fairly unimaginative and have very little involvement in game events; they also force you to play as an expansive empire. But, mostly, there is no history to interact with. Everything here is up the player\'s devising. Sure, there\'s references to other space operas, and this game is undeniably a space opera, its just that its so open-ended that, in order to have an experience similar to say, CK2, the player will have to manufacture characters and plots and flavor themselves.
I do this fairly easy. Thus, once they fix mechanics and optimizing and other such things, I will be able to enjoy the game quite a bit. Others, however, will see this as bland and flavorless, and that is their right.
I still reccomend the game, though. This price point, which would have made me balk a decade ago, is now a full $20 less than the AAA industry standard for a base game. The DLC will be expensive as a total, but as with all PDX games the basic features of each will be included in a patch, and much of the dlc will be cosmetic, in this case perhaps new ships and races. DLC is annoying, yes, but its the state of the industry, and I think PDX is one of the few companies that does it correctly, with each release being a fairly large game changer.
If you REALLY like sci fi strategy games where you build and maintain empires in a space opera setting, I\'d reccomend Stellaris, as it will probably shape up to be really good compared to the ones out now. If you like historical grand strategy games like the rest of what PDX does, I would hold off and wait a while. The game will certainly improve, but whether it does so in a way equitable to those types of players, I am not sure.			"

 Thier are no tactical options, or any control besides retreating once forces have met, and the ship combat AI at times has your ships turn away from the enemy fleet and not fire and just get shot up, or some such.

And many of the problems it has you'd think the developer would've known how to avoid after making games like HoI3 and EUIV, but somehow they seemed to have forgotten most of these critical features.  Luckily, like most Paradox games, they will be making many updates and improvements over time.  Hopefully that won't cost a small fortune in DLC though.
Pros:
Good graphics
Various exploration and galactic events
Diverse government and race types
Multiple races are actually handled properly
Designing ships and stations is pretty easy
Research is not all one type, but instead is split into physics, society, and engineering (about time someone realized that not all scientists are experts in all fields and can just bounce between them with no regard for their specialty)
Stations can be used to increase your amount of resources and expand your borders, not just build defenses
Research costs scale with empire population size, so you can't just blob out and expect to out tech everyone instantly
Cons:
Full scale bombardment is the most pathetic bombardment ever, it should not take a huge fleet years to do minor damage to a planet
Controlling/Upgrading/Building Armies is a pain in the ♥♥♥ (why can't they act like, you know, garrisoned transports, so you can control group them, and send them to a location)
Armies don't heal while in transports, making landing and sorting through the damaged ones a pain in the ♥♥♥
Combat balance is non-existent, armor, shields, energy weapons, armor pen, missiles, pd and ballistics all need to be reworked
Defending your empire is basically impossible due to the lack of sensor range, pathetic defense stations, and no way to slow down an enemy fleet from jumping without them jumping on that station and instantly killing it
Space Combat encourages doom stacks with only one or two minor fleets to go around killing enemy stations
Interface is completely useless once you get past your core planet limit, making it way harder to build ships, upgrade starports, do terraforming, colonize, quickly check who's allied with who, who's fighting who than it should be
Some notifications pop up way too much, while others don't pop up enough (why no combat warning when my stations are in combat)
Ship design needs to have more impact on what type of ship you're trying to make, either a heavy slow armored ship, or a light heavy weapon ship
No control of ships during combat, and no way to give formations or any type of orders beforehand
Overall, it's an ok game, but with more work on the interface and the combat balance, the game could be epic.  So for now, I won't recommend it, but once they fix some of these issues, definitely pick it up.			"

Then move him to the next world instantly since there is no travel time involved and queue up more discounted buildings.  Repeat for each of your planets.  I can understand AI issues arising say in the Sector management, but bugs where you can apply a leadership bonus from one leader across every planet, well that\'s poor quality assurance.  And that is just one such bug.  Want to instantly move two fleets together in a system?  Well just drag a window around them and combine the fleets.  Even though they are weeks away from meeting, now they are instantly combined, no travel time involved to group!  How about quests to scout 6 planets and then you find that 2 of the planets are behind another empire\'s borders and unreachable?  And the auto design optimizer for ships doesn\'t upgrade weapons at all, prefering to just maximize shields and armor while your ships keep the most basic of weapons.  Building frontier outposts is always a risk since it doesn\'t display the area of influence prior to building them, so you may accidentally build it too far out to be part of your empire,

C'est un jeu Paradoxe. Rien que ça.
Le jeu en lui même est bon. Les musiques et le gameplay sont cool. Plusieurs MaJ arrivent très bientôt pour appronfondir ce jeu, car il en a hélas besoin.
J'ai l'impression, dans ce jeu, que pour survivre, il faut absolument faire la guerre... Je me trompe ?
En soi, c'est pas dérangeant au début. c'est sympa de construire des armées et des flottes pour ruiner et envahir les planètes ennemies, mais à la longue, je trouve ça reellement pénible. Si quelqu'un te fait de l'ombre, tu dois absolument construire une grosse flotte pour le convaincre de te foutre la paix, auquel cas, s'il n'est pas pacifiste ni xénophile, il te tape dessus avec une floppée de revendication ! O.o
Mais passons, le jeu n'est tout de même pas QUE guerre. Le système diplomatique est assez bien geré, sauf pour les vassaux qui, quoi qu'il arrive, te deteste pour X raisons (et y en aura toujours une). Les différentes politiques changent tout de même pas mal de chose sur ton jeu, que se soit pour l'économie de l'empire en temps de guerre, les lois sur l'extermination et/ou l'esclavage d'alien en passant par la légalité des êtres robotiques au sein de l'empire.
Les recherches technologiques sont aussi vraiment pas mal du tout. En presque 60 heures de jeu, j'en decouvre encore (et heureusement) et cela me surprend assez de voir que les devs au mit des techs capablent ou non de te faire terminer ta partie (SPOIL:           La tech ""dangereuse"" de l'IA avancée, par exemple       ).
Les graphismes sont beaux. Rien a dire. Même pour les vaisseaux, quelle que soit la race de départ, ils pètent la rétine et une customisation est possible pour chaque modèle (et possibilité d'en créer d'autre). Les systèmes aussi sont bien bossés, avec une floppée de planètes différentes les une des autres pour X raisons.
Avec le petit souci des temps de guerre (car oui, il est vraiment petit), le seul gros point noir du jeu est, je trouve, que le mode normal n'est pas assez dur. Il est assez facile de dépasser ses voisins sans justement trop les tabassers à coup de torpille super-nucléaire VI-de-la-mort-qui-tue obtenue dans une tech rare ou alors, il est pas compliqué de faire une alliance et de la maintenir longtemps avec d'autre empire pour rester tranquille.
Stellaris ne vaut pas son prix. Pour le moment il est trop cher par rapport à ce qu'il offre malgré ce qu'il à pour le moment à offrir et que je n'ai pas cité plus haut (encore de nombreux beugs visuel/ si l'on possède une flotte assez conséquente, le jeu ralenti de manière incontrôlable ..ect).

281990,Taeryn,7,12,0,True,227.3,May 24,"Stellaris starts strong, putting you in charge of a pre-made race that populates the new game screen, or more interestingly, one of the many combinations that can be made to make your own unique race or variety of human, with various traits and ethics and bonuses from government forms.
The early-game is very much exploration and colonisation, with a variety of alien life not of another empire and the various event mechanics put to good use in anomalies that pop up as you survey. There are others that occur, tied to your colonies either through the previous anomalies discovering something or their own, seperate unique chains. Anomalies can range from everything to a resource or research boon, either on the planet or to your stockpile, to out-right changing some world's biosphere's or sending you to discover the secrets of a precursor race, something full of lore that kept my attention through many ingame decades.
The tech tree is ""randomized"" with a ""card"" system that draws 3, or more depending on certain techs or government types, cards, allowing you to choose from a selection of techs. You'll eventually see most of the techs - but some are tied to certain ethics and will never be seen whilst playing an opposing one, while others are rare and can take many a shuffle to re-appear. The tech tree also continues beyond actual techs, to minimally rewarding ""buff"" statistics. This system is a good compromise between meaningless stat buffs, a randomized tech tree, and a straight up ""plow through this in the most efficient way possible"". The tech system as such gets a solid thumbs up from me, but others may get frustrated by the random nature of it. This is complimented by a debris system where destroyed ships and stations add techs - don't forget to scroll the tech cards to see!
The mid-game is where Stellaris begins to lose some of its glamour. The galaxy fills with empires and many a time, you're cut off from exploring. There are still a few events, typically colony ones, here and there, but it becomes a period of saturising your own territory and often war for wars own sake. Personally, I like to fill this time with uplifting - a process of technological enlightenment for some of the planets in the galaxy that start with their own, pre-ftl  or spaceflight civilizations (how cool is that?!) and a few rare worlds with pre-sentient races that require genetic modification. This part of the game is particularly weak, and some of the flaws in the systems meant to ease micromanagement falter.
The late-game becomes a traditional game of jockeying for power, with wars now serving a purpose of dealing with real rivals and threats that the mid-game doesn't quite seem to give. Most importantly, the true end-game crises begin in 2 flavours. The game has 3 end-game crises, that I won't spoil, that really shake things up, providing they don't stall out against a Fallen Empire - the other ""end game"". The end-game crises can wipe out old rivals and new friends alike. Don't underestimate them if they end up on your door and you're not prepared. Sadly due to the Fallen Empire mechanics currently crises can suffer if forced to push through one of these.
Fallen Empire's constitute the other, ever-present problem. Coming in four varities with differing views on the galaxy, each knowable by hovering over their ""attitude type"" in the diplomacy screen and from experience of them telling you exactly what they dont like - typically followed by the hammer. They exist from the start of the game and represent the apex of technology, though they have the full tech tree researched, they don't research any further than that. Provided you don't evoke their wrath, build up and take them on for valuable worlds and, if you're lagging behind in tech but adept at strategy and tactics, scanning their debris can offer you a leg up.
At this point, the galaxy is what you make of it and imagination and roleplay help. Stellaris features victory screens, but seem to be largely pointless.
There are lots of little things and systems inside the game I havn't touched upon here that I would encourage you to seek out and enjoy, particularly special systems that spawn, systems such as slavery and, of course, genocide, though you know, be nice! Even with all my time in the game, I'm still uncovering new things and experiencing new events and new emergent stories.
Also, you can have an actual Earth with the proper texture, what's not to love? Oh, and if you're aliens.. Sol is out there somewhere!
-----
Pros:
-A Strong Start, with fun customization leading to your own, unique characterization, particularly as you explore and pull back the veil.
-Damn pretty for a Clausewitz game. Most of the game is wonderful to look at.
-Lots of little touches and in particular some of the events and anomalies add atmosphere
-Fallen Empire's offer a unique twist to the galaxy
-Tech and debris offer an enjoyable overall system
-You can build robots and give them rights.
-End-Game Crises shake up the late-game galaxy.
-A fantastic emergent storyline that arises out of these systems can lead to great ~roleplay~ if you care for that.
-Multiplayer is incredibly stable.
-Game is stable in general.
-Moddability.
Cons:
-Sector AI is wonky and the AI in general can be wonky.
-Galaxy can become static, though this is largely due to the game seeming to love to fill it with pacifists, a minor deviation from this pacifists for all makes things much more violent - and even pacifists go to war. It's a problem I've not noticed but one I know occurs.
-AI is slow to expand. It doesn't weight certain colony techs as high as a player would and consequently takes it's time. It will, however, do so en masse in time.
-A few minor localization bugs and one rather moderate multiplayer bug I've found, though it doesn't affect stability.
-Combat a little wonky and brawly.
-Slaves can't currently rebel, making this broken if you min-max that route.

I've mentioned a few of the flaws in this as we've gone through. Critically, mid-game suffers from not being fleshed out as the early game, nor with the threats posed in the late game. This is being somewhat addressed by the upcoming 1.1 patch, and should be treated accordingly. 
Some say the universe feels a little lifeless without civilian traffic and such - this is hopefully being made an addition in 1.3, but is not ""critical"".
The 1.1 patch will also address a number of small AI issues, and larger ones related to sector management. Personally, I've noted lots of minor niggling flaws that I essentially could argue as being ""inefficient"" - and so I just let the sector AI do what it wants, but understand the problems others have.
One major stumbling block is currently how end-game crises are treated as ""wildlife"" and not at war with AI empires, allowing things such as the ""at peace"" fallen empire fleet respawn to occur, thus preventing the crises from knocking them out, as well as how the AI empires in general only react to the end-game crises assaults if they are actively threatening important worlds. This is hopefully being fixed, for the latter, in 1.1.
The mid-game slump is also due to be addressed by the 1.2 patch, with further flavour and life added in 1.3 - you may wish to hold off on your purchase till 1.1, if not 1.2.
Stellaris is a solid game, and despite its flaws and small bugs, though sometimes numerous, are all easily redeemable. Critically, none of the problems seem to be with the core mechanics and more with execution and the always tempermental AI.
Currently, a lot of mods address issues and add new gameplay. This is a blessing for the moddability and future of the game - but also a remark on how some dislike the combat, so go in with eyes wide open.
This is easily a recommendable purchase, but for those who want a ""cleaner"" experience I do advise waiting until 1.2. 1.1 if you can forgive a slower mid-game.			"

281990,masstech,7,12,0,False,17.3,June 2,"Good game when it comes to graphics, performance, I think they fixed a few bugs which I have yet to notice, but the game IS lacking in a few departments.
1.)
Tech tree is not your typical tech tree, where it gives you a list or path of techs you can get. It gives you an option of 3 or 4 tech options to choose from, based on your government set up in the beginning of the game and what you've already researched. This means that upgrading to better ships is not an easy task, unless you do some research on google, chances of getting better ships is trial and error.
2.)
There's no real trading. Meaning you don't collect certain valuable resources that can be traded for favors. There are no trading zones or lanes, no trading buildings or vessels. Trade seems to be a huge advantage in these types of games and this game lacks it.
3.) 
Combat is a little ridiculous. You have the option to make a ton of ""fleets"" but you might as well meld them into 1 giant fleet and try dominating other planets. The animation has them swarming around each other, but that's not very realistic combat in space. You can't exactly do tactical movements and the game doesn't tactically put important ships in the back with fodder in the front, because when you attack another fleet it's just 1 large swarm of missiles, lasers and projectiles. Sins of a Solar Empire has much better fleet/battle mechanics
4.)
Once you get to a certain point where you make insanely large amounts of social influence, energy credits and minerals, the game is just sort of click and play, the most you have to do is micromanage random factions that appear in your worlds.
5.) 
There is no esponiage. You'd think espionage would be a big part of a space game, park your stealth ship in orbit in another's empire, learn their movements, important travel lanes, economy and sense of political stability/instability so you can attack them at the right time or place. There's none of that.
6.)
A few aspects of the enemy AI. I have yet to be majorly attacked by them, even after openly declaring total war with the intent of subjugating few and purging the rest. A few skirmishes, but I have yet to have a full on war with another empire that took all of my attention and focus. I'm guessing that if you chose hard mode, war becomes impossible with them because you'll lose, not sure if true or not because i've only been playing mid difficulty.
That's all I really have on it. For the price, I'd pay for something else, but if you don't care about money and need to throw away some time I'd get it.			"

281990,acriaos,8,14,0,False,114.5,June 23,"The main problem in this game are two things: AI and UI. Unfortunately both are pretty important for a 4x game and both are unlikely to be improved soon.
The game has some good ideas and the basics of a 4x game are definitely there. Especially the exploration part is well done and at the beginning it's also fun to expand your empire. However, there are way too many problems which suck the fun out. For me the main problem are the sectors: After you have more than 5 planets you are forced to give some of the planets to sectors which are managed by the AI. Afterwards all you can do is watch the AI horribly mismanaging your planets and costing you a lot of resources without being productive. They improved it slightly with patches 1.1 and 1.2 but the main problem remains: It is just not fun expanding your empire just to give it to an AI - even more so if it's an AI with the brain capacity of a lobotomized monkey. 
There are other problems such as the combat which is simply ""the bigger stack wins"", a concept which I thought game devs today would know to be a bad idea or the UI which requires about twice as many clicks for every action than would be necessary. Actually if the UI would be better, probably less people would complain about micromanaging and there could be better solutions to it than the one currently implemented.
Maybe the game will be fun in a year or so, but right now it's pretty obvious you are playing a beta.			"
281990,76561197977893329,9,16,0,True,224.1,May 31,"My ""Yes"" recommendation has reservations.
The game is very solid. I encountered no bugs or crashes, and the UI, while different from what I'm used to (I've never played a Paradox game before) is relatively intuitive. The graphics are beautiful with no observed artifacts, as are the sounds (although the music gets repetitive.) The tutorial is bare-bones, and there is no manual other than the Stellaris WIki that can be accessed within the game.
I have two real beefs with the game, however: the AI-controlled sector management hides too much important info from the player, and the mid-to-late game crises are often game-endingly brutal.
In the interest of manageability, you are limited to direct control of only 5 planets. You may group additional planets into sectors which are managed by the AI. This is fine except that should you build colony ships in a starbase in one of the AI-controlled sectors, the player receives only a brief notification when the ship is ready for use. This can be critical because colony ships drain energy credits like mad until the colony is created.  Colony ships created on non-sector planets are displayed as Civilian Ships in the Outliner (a quick access menu on the right side of the screen) but sector-created colony ships are not.  If you don't handle the ship when the notification pops up, the player is forced to manually check each starbase until he locates the colony ship, which becomes clumsy and tiresome as your empire grows. Paradox should address this issue in a future patch.
The more serious issue is the inevitable mid-to-late game crisis. As your empire grows, you will encounter one or more older races which are overwhelmingly advanced and xenophobic. Just encountering them is sufficient to provoke a game-ending jihad by an insanely powerful race bent on your destruction. The frustrating part is that you can't avoid these berserkers if you expand, and if you don't expand, your empire will die. So far I haven't figured out how to avoid this seemingly inevitable extinction; I'm usually the strongest empire when I encounter the berserkers but neither I nor my alliance can beat them nor can they be negotiated with. It is just game over...			"

Mostly posting a first impressions review after the first few hours of gameplay in order to offer any insight for other newbs who come from similar games.  Stellaris is a soothing, mysterious, and alive experience... something I've never felt from a game like Sins, where so much of the emphasis was placed on combat and grabbing things as fast as you could.  There's a slower pace that is most certainly intentional, with a pretty good tutorial to ease you in.
Early on, the biggest challenges I faced and am still facing are learning what resources are most important, realizing what buildable objects are a drain that I didn't expect (outposts taking influence), being caught with my pants down as a faction of my people split off and started taking out my my mining structures far away from my home planet, and figuring out how fast I should expand vs. fortify.
The scientific missions and anomalies you stumble across while surveying systems has been the highlight so far.  I've taken joy in reading the lovingly crafted blurbs of text that describe all kinds of alien flora and fauna, how your crew interacted with them upon encountering and discovering, and the personal touch that makes it seem like you're truly living out YOUR expanding empire through YOUR people.  To have something to do that isn't just dealing with another AI civilization or expanding for expansion's sake?  Really makes space feel more alive than one could possibly hope for.
I understand why Stellaris is hard to put down once you get settled in.  So much to discover, just one more system to scan, one more hilariously terrifying description to read, and so on.  The pace is certainly slow, especially since you can pause to get your bearings as much as you please, but it's welcome as I can still feel invested in my gametime, while not feeling like I can't pause for a few minutes to get up and take a break, or tab out while all my vessels are scanning special projects and read some news.

281990,JeffSproul,0,0,0,True,44.7,May 10,"This game is like a better Civ 3. It's like a better Endless Space (If you prefer RTS opposed to turn-based.)   
It's one of the best Scifi space Rts's I've ever played. It could use a little extra polish in the form of optimization and clearing out a few bugs. When Vermintide released, it was VERY poorly optimized. Hell, when Ark came out (admittedly it was in EA for a long time) It needed weeks before it was playable on most machines.
Stellaris is a game that's going to eat away every hour of spare time I have when I'm not working. (Please don't take my working hours too. I need to eat something more than ramen every once in a while.)
If there is DLC it's almost instantly going to be a buy. An expansion? Insta buy. This game is amazing and feature-full. There's a lot of 'winks' / 'hat tilts' / 'easter-eggs' in the events, but they're not blatant like Borderlands games. It's not full of memes, but if you look carefully, you'll get what's going on.
There's soooo many things I want to talk about event-wise, but I think all the fun is in finding them for yourself.
The only thing I CAN'T recommend right now is Iron Man Mode. It saves constantly and really slows down the pace of things. The constant saving with the (eventual) optimization issues that come into play late-game, make it a bit rough at times.
But with that said, this is a 10/10.

Overall, it is the perfect mix of 4x and grand strategy. People have criticized the games shortcoming and bugs *cough* *cough* IGN, but just look at the support this game has.
On day 1, I and many others experienced a stuttering bug. Where everything stuttered and made the game nearly unplayable. Now, on day 2, that has been fixed in a hotfix patch. The devs have even stated, in their launch stream, that they intend to release DLC adding what players think is the weakest part of the game.
These are truly great devs. They have continued to support CK2 and EU4, and will do the same for Stellaris. This game is great now, but with Paradox's support over the years it could be a masterpiece.

There are tons of species varieties and ways to really customize your empire.
I definitely feel like I have tough choices to make regarding resource management, research decisions, and responding to events in the game (like dealing with new alien species). There's always something happening. I love it.

So, remember that time in Middle and High School where you bought a new game and every waking moment all you wanted to do was play it? You would think about it at school all day. You would play it immediately when you got home and get so angry because your mom wanted you to do chores and eat. That inner spark (some would call addiction) that makes you utterly enchanted by a game. Well, Stellaris has, for the first time in my adult life, brought back these feelings. I'm do disenchanted with gaming as an adult because I regret my purchase 24 hours later. Not this game. I feel like I'm in high school again, wanting to abandon every part of my life to grow a galactic empire.

The midgame smoothly transitions from a more 4x style gameplay to one the is more similar to eu4. There are many novel ideas.

The difficulty curve isn't quite so harsh as the infamous steep curve of EUIV/CK2, with helpful (but not too intrusive) info pop-ups explaining the various components of the game, and a helpful starter tutorial to get you into the swing of things. The mechanisms of the game are probably fairly familiar to people who've played games like Galactic Civilisations, but with enough originality, depth and fluidity to keep you satisifed.
It's not perfect; still some early glitches and bugs to be rooted out, but two hotfixes have already been pushed out and more patches are yet to come.

Secondly, the best way I can describe this game is that it's what Sid Meier's Starships or Spore's Space Stage wanted to be, but they didn't have the time/money/â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s to give. Stellaris is probably the best type 2 civ building game on Steam (at time of writing) and if you enjoy 4x games then it is well worth the asking price.
Pros:
+ Custom alien creation
+ Good combat system
+ Pretty good tutorial
+ Calming, atmospheric soundtrack.
Cons:
- There's a bit of a learning curve (the game pretty much assumes this isn't your first strategy game)
Weirdness:
? All aliens apparently have pretty static male and female sexes/genders and I personally find that weird given that even life on Earth has more variety than that. I mean, aphids are all essentially born pregnant, ants and bees have queens that serve as mothers to entire colonies, male seahorses can become pregnant, certain species of fish can change their sex according to their environment... this list can go on. It's not a BAD design decision, but it is WEIRD given that these are aliens we're talking about and that it would be a pretty funny coincidence for all sapient species in the galaxy to reproduce or express gender and sexuality in the exact same way. Then again, I'm probably overthinking it.			"

Problem is, I found stellaris while waiting for MOOCTS to become less buggy, and more like MOO2..... and it turns out stellaris everything I've looking for in a 4X space game and more. 
A Few Things:
The game gives you the feel of actually exploring out from your solar system. Surveying feels meaningful and enjoyable with storyline elements and technlogies introduced from discoveries. 
The choices you make in creating a race have a definite effect on how your empire will grow and what problems you will encounter in your growth.
Space battles are enjoyable and actually performed in the same solar system view, in real time, as your empire management. No clunky transition or other players having to wait. Balance of the ship weapons and attributes could be adjusted a bit but I have no real suggestions on how to addequately do so.
Technology research feels meaningful, having standard, rare, reverse engineered, and dangerous technologies to choose from, each with there intrinsic benefits and risks is new to me. Technologies seem to impact game mechanics enough to really try and research and aquire/level-up scientists.
Having leaders, governors, admirals, and generals is a nice throwback to MOO2. Their benefits, stats, and effects on gameplay make them important and valuable... and dissappointing when they die of old age.
AI is enjoyable but could use some work. There are a few quirks that I'm sure are not attributed to be a race actually being programmed to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most of these quirks happen to be odd behavior and responses when trading/treaties/etc., a few others are in the actual war goals management and/or the behavior of attacking fleets during wartime. These minor AI issues do not reduce the enjoyment of the game enough not to buy it though. 
Buy it. Enjoy it. Enough said.			"

My brethren followed while I led them on a noble quest to scan our local planets (The heck - I didn't see Pluto...WHERE DID PLUTO GO?!). From there I scanned local star systems, and settled some of the scruffier humans (They claimed they were ""Individualists"" - but look...showers were invented for a reason people...) on distant worlds. 
In an inspired moment I promptly declared war on some local gang of rednecks claiming to be a Fallen Empire. I think it went well, I mean it did offer our scientists a nice close up view of a death ray, which really helped our theoreticians...
Errr..yeah don't do that. Anyway this game really sucks you in, I had just bought DOOM and it's just been gathering the digital equivalent of dust once I started playing this. I like how leaders (scientists, fleet admirals, planetary governors, generals) actually age â€“ and die (make sure you keep some influence in reserve to buy new ones). 
The way the game handles tech is...different. There isn't so much as a tech tree as a choice of semi random technologies to pursue.  This can be a little frustrating when a tech you didn't choose to research in the past doesn't show up again. Certainly makes you think about tech choices in a different light. As my empire grows I am beginning to see how managing a larger and larger empire takes more and more time, although I suppose this is true in most 4x games. 
That said, I heartily recommend this title.

 First of all, i can't actually believe that Paradox came up with such a game. The mechanics are quite different than what we used to and that's a good thing in my book. Designing your ship is a great part of the game -- the game offers a lot of weapon types, some with specific bonuses like ""50% Armor Penetration"" or ""50% Shield Penetration"" type of bonuses. There are lots of other parts to place on your ships aswell. The game mechanics are quite good considering it's still new, of course it needs some polishing and on that account i have no doubt, Paradox will do the job. The only negative part i observed is that when you spawn at a random star system in the galaxy, there will be some systems around you occupied by random NPC groups (not factions) and sometimes it takes so much time get rid of them and in the process, you'll need use a large sum of materials. 
  Before i finish, i must admit, the musics are awesome in my opinion! And i should say something about the packages they offer which includes, most importantly, original soundtracks and a new race. But if you gonna ask if it worths the price, i'd say no. Races have no specific trait of ability so there is no point to pay for that imo. About the soundtracks, we didn't see any differences, my friend and I -- he didn't buy with a package.
  In conclusion, if you like RTS games and Space genre at the same time, i'd strongly recommend you try this one out!
P.S: By package i mean (Nova for example)			"
281990,vmfstorm1,0,0,0,True,105.5,May 13,"This game is just a perfect blend of all of the great space-faring games released to date.  While the ship customization isnt as in depth as lets say Galactic Civilizations 2, it is still a great piece of the game.  The star systems are all highly variable between the number of planets, anomalies etc.  Another thing done very right that many games seem to just glance over are moons, I stumbled upon a system with 2 planets, one barren lifeless world unsuitable for colonization, and the other was a gas giant with 5 moons, 3 of which were colonizable.  I was playing as the Human race, for some reason in the future we become very tolerant of other species and I had several that I had lifted up from the various ages to join me in my interstellar empire.  The three moons became part of my dominion and were all more or less suitable to one of the races I had in my empire.
And that's really what makes this game so great, these little minor flavor enhancers that Paradox is so good at including, you can uplift various species to join you, or simply annihilate them and take their home world, or simply just watch them progress naturally.  You can form galactic alliances and federations (a delightful thing that lets each member nation be the ""president"" for a few years, allowing them to declare war and design the ships that everyone uses).  Generally its just fun to start a new game and cruise around the galaxy discovering new people to make friends and enemies with.  
There is a huge variety of possible AI and User civs to play as, and the customization is pretty deep.  You'll encounter everything from civs that just want to work together to civs that will stop at nothing to destroy all other life forms in the galaxy.
The ONLY issue that I have with the game thus far is the sort of 'end-game' scenario, sort of like an old school Crusader Kings Mongol Invasion.  Basically these people called the Unbidden/Praethoryn Swarm come out of an interdimensional warp and have 20k power doomstacks issue forth like water from a fountain.  They then proceed to dominate the galaxy until you the player stop them, as no AI i have seen in 3 games can even come close.  My Federation held out for awhile, but only because we were 6 civs strong with no real galactic challengers, but even so it came down to my personal military to beat them, and that many ships gets very expensive when theyre not in orbit on a station.  Beating them gives a huge buff to opinions for a short time, but still is not worth the hassle in my opinion.
On the other hand, the AI uprising is much easier to cope with, just grant the synths (yes like in fallout 4) full rights and there is no issue.  However, if other civs dont do this, then the uprising will start regardless.  The good part is that they also need to research the sentient ai tech in order to build synths in the first place.  
Out of 10 singleplayer and a few multiplayer games, the vast majority have been Unbidden invasions for me, the luckiest I got was when it was in one of my main systems and easily destroyed.
TL;DR Again, this does not effect my suggestion to buy this game.  Paradox has demonstrated time and again they are capable of fixing their blunders and vastly improving games over time.  I HIGHLY suggest this to any fan of the sci-fi genre, especially the more politically inclined book and game series.			"

+Epic Scale, the largest galaxies can have 1000 Star Systems, each with multiple planets
+Beautiful Graphics, the battles look great, weapon effects and sounds are good for the most part
+Customization of Species traits, Government, Appearance, Names etc.
+Ship design, a very user friendly ship design
+Multiple interesting events and locations to explore
+Different FTL systems that really change how you play and explore the Galaxy
+Long term epic strategy, you can take a species that you discover on a planet from Iron Age tech up to eventually be assimilated into your Empire as an equal member-species (It takes a long time, but I've done it!)
-Limit of 5 planets (Initially, can be increased through tech) that you directly manage. You have to create 'sectors' to control more. The AI that manages you sectors really sucks, I had to take a system out of a sector and manage it myself for a while then put it back it as the AI wasn't doing anything I asked it to do. I supplied the sector with plenty of resources to build up those planets within its control.
-No tech tree, you get a draw of 3 techs to research (initially, you receive more through exploring and tech upgrades) It makes it hard to plan out what tech you want to research initially, but with further play this might be less of an issue
-limited trade with other species, I had a surplus of energy and shortage of minerals, but I couldn't trade away my surplus fast enough to supplement my mineral requirements. The AI usually wants to have a better deal than you are getting otherwise it will reject it. Also, sometimes they won't even trade with you despite you giving them a huge advantage, they still feel insulted that you offered them that deal??			"

Cons:-Color picker? Flag patterns and colors need more variations.
-Still some UI bugs and fleet-moving bugs. They can be ignored, but I still hope patches would fix them.
-Researchings are too slow in late game, which makes game a lil boring.
-A large galaxy means serious delay and slowness in late game. My poor CPU definitely can't stand that LOL. And I play tiny or small galaxies now.
-Ships are various but equips are not that many to choose from. And the domination of laser weapons leaves no other choice.

I've been so eager for months and now this game released. Although many stuffs are not satisfying, as of a starting version, I can't expect more from this game.

With just 5 hours played, at the point this review is written, I may havenÂ´t experienced the whole range of this game, but to this point it has been an absolute blast. When you first step into the game (after creating your own race, which took me about 30 minutes), you get overwhelmed by the awesome design this game has. Feeling like the conquerer of the universe, your goal is to expand your empire, found colonies and lead wars against other empires, which can be AI or other players in the multiplayer mode. The interface is well structured and easy to handle. After some time, you might lose your orientation a bit, but with time it gets better and you get used to where to look for your ships. The contact interface with other alien species is extremtley well desinged and talking to other life, is very interesting. Coming to solutions suitable for both parties might not be easy and take some time, but in the end youÂ´ll come to a good end.

Lets see:
Stellaris is basically everything you ever wanted from a Master Of Orion game. Giant galaxies with up to 1000 stars, populated by numerous civilizations. I think the maximum is like 60 or so, but I didn't try it. But that's only starting civilizations, new ones can form later on. You can found federations together with other civilizations, with entirely self-declared rules. Those federations will vote a president from all the member civs from time to time which then controls most of the foreign and military policies. But it's not a simple alliance spam like in many other games. You'll find tons of civilization with which you won't even get close to an alliance, just because your own civilization's policies don't match with theirs.
The constant construction of more infrastructure like mining stations, research stations a.s.o. is incredibly rewarding. Warfare is not just like conquer as much as you can, but instead you need to keep an eye on resources. Can you maintain that extra planet? Is a war worth it for that incredibly rich border system?
Combine Master Of Orion with the complexity of a Paradox game (don't worry, it's not as complex as EU4, but still very in-depth) and you'll end up with Stellaris. I can already see my dump another 1000 hours of game time into this one.
Current flaws, early after release include:
- Some bugs with storylines. Like you can't finish a research project here and there because that probe you need to collect isn't clickable. Nothing game breaking, but annoying.
- Some balancing problems. Normal difficulty is way too easy and I easily stomped everybody. My attempt on hard was exactly the opposite. Feels a bit like too much depends on the starting position at the moment, but I'm sure Paradox will tweak it quite soon.

The good
+ Runs well on low spec machines
+ Well scripted events
+ Variety of events
+ Ship designer
+ Amount of alien races
+ Universe that is big enough to play for a very long time
+ New user friendly
The bad
- AI are very passive againts player
- AI never attacks you
- Simplified politics

281990,zeduu,0,0,0,True,272.3,May 15,"Like many of Paradox's grand strategy games (CK2, EU4), the DLC is going to make or break Stellaris. Is the base game playable? Definitely. Is the base game replayable? Maybe a couple of times.
Is the effort that went into Stellaris worth $40? Yes, but the DLCs are going to have to be epic or cheap!
I like lists, so here you go...
Pros:
-First and foremost, very unique pacing/tech ""tree"" for a space 4x. I feel this is the core of the game. If you don't like CK2 or EU4 pacing, you will hate Stellaris' pacing. I love it. More realistic!
-Simple yet interesting custom species.
-Simple galaxy creation; decent variety.
-Optional sagnant advance-technolgy AI starts.
-Quirky variety of FTL travel.
-No spearate scout ship class! (Yes, this is a pro! Just send a corvette!)
-Empire AND planetary AND researchable Edicts!
-Advanced government types (although could use fleshing out).
-Robots, Droids, and Sentients! Oh my!
-Simple spaceport customization (but could use more module options).
-Simple, interesting ship designer, with Auto-Best!
-Quick load times. Not overly demanding on system resources.
Neutral:
-Graphics. Paradox always does enough to make graphics interesting but never fantastic.
-Species can only colinize one type of planet at start. IRL, atmospheric chemistry is more important than biome, and arguably, for example, humanoids could colonize all of the biomes at start, especially assuming habitats would be available in 2200. Planet colonization limitations needs be fleshed out. I understand why they did it this way (simplicity), but it's still dull.
-Bombardment is awkwardly done, but whatever (see also: ""armies/transports are lame"" below).
-Government, Budget, and Demographics tabs are interesting but currently mostly useless.
-The species tab gets lost in the mix, but it can be especially important after Gene Tailoring. The tab gets cumbersome with high populations/planets.
-Fleet upgrading takes a long time, but just split the fleet and use different space stations, I guess. Maybe add a refueler/repair/upgrade base or more impactful modules.
-Dull vassalization system. Also, shouldn't uplifted species be integrated immediately?
-Needs many more non-science event chains. (See also: ""factions are lame"" below.)
-Fedarations are dull. I smell a DLC there.
Cons/Bugs:
-Semi-useless tutorial. Clicking-through does as much. Complex UI, so multiple click-throughs needed to get scope of tabs. Easy to forget ""things I can do.""
-Species traits need more impact on gameplay.
-Can feel slow;  not enough to do, especially early. ""Fastest"" isn't very fast.
-Conversely, there is no auto-scout option.
-Most Alerts are pointless. Only Hostile Empire Fleet, Survey, and Research Alerts are meaningful.
-Situation log needs ability to ""track all.""
-Other Empires are ridiculously adverse to trading you anything, even when you can crush them without thought, at which point negotiation is pointless.
-When maxing out on resource storage, improving storage, using them, or distributing them (to sectors) is annoying.
-Army management UI is awful. Transports are lame.
-Policies tab is confusing to navigate and a policy's detailed effects are difficult to predict.
-Too slavery-focused, and not enough pros to slavery.
-Needs more ethics divergence and faction interference/rebellion.
-Scientist deaths are particularly annoying; needs option to auto-hire and auto-assign to best job.
-Control over Sectors needs to be slightly greater (observation posts, option to take energy but not minerals, etc).
-I can uplift pre-sentients and advance post-neolithics, but can't do anything to those in between? WTF.
-The AI is moderately dumb. AI will not put up multiple fronts. They go straight for your homeworld almost always. They capitulate on relatively even-footing relatively quickly. When weak, they pull ships from defensible positions to attack. Etc, etc, etc.
-Inability to re-negotiate peace conditions.
-Stagnant Empires need to be less stagnant. They need SOME initiative, such as peace keeping or science regression or desire for transience or religious fanatacism or....
-Needs more achievements (these are sure to come).
-Needs more victory conditions (coming soon surely; ought to be part of free DLC).
Note: I have not played multiplayer.
TL;DR: Despite the length of my Cons/Bugs, Paradox does more good than evil; if you like 4x's, buy this game.			"

281990,auldben,0,0,0,True,17.4,May 15,"I'm relatively new to Paradox games, and I'll admit, I only heard of Stellaris about a month ago. Nonetheless, I bought it, took the plunge and I have to say, it's really, really good.
I'm no good at in depth reviews, but it has a way of sucking you in, the scale of the galaxies, the ability to lead your race in whatever direction you want (I'm tired of grand space strategy where your only real option is combat) and the option to enslave an entire race of creatures because they've only achieved Medieval stages of life is superb.
It does have some faults though. The trading is bit dull and the politics between races is a bit lame (I hardly talk to other races unless I need extra resources) It'd be awesome if Paradox or a mod expanded on that area, maybe made it closer to say CKII or something. Mixing races and family trees and stuff would cool.
Over all though, well worth the purchase. Likely to get even better as Paradox inevitably release DLC packs too.			"
281990,76561198026069206,0,0,0,True,58.8,May 15,"More accessible than any other Paradox strategy game. Stellaris has a lot going for it (cool techs, extensive customization and creation of player species, visually tasty ship combat) and it has a very nice learning curve. 
The game also has a lot of replayability. Species traits and ethics alter your options in various situations: A xenophobe militarist species may solve revolts on a conquered planet by killing the less obedient people on the planet. Xenophile species may resettle people or sent some of their own to conquered planets. Or if you are a more peaceful species you may have won that planet as an ally or protectorate in the first place. A variety of quests and events also bring variation to each playthrough.
Here are some of the negative aspects as well:
- Visually, the galaxymap is a rather boring matter. The planetgraphics are lacking in variation (an earthlike planet always looks the same, an arctic world always looks the same, oceanworlds always have blue oceans). The background could use some variation too.
- Gamebreaking glitches. I heard of ships spawning in the middle of the universe, unable to move. Then there are event-enemies whose planets are unconquerable and indestructable, effectly rendering an enemy immortal (they can't be befriended, can't be killed, can't be destroyed.)
- Combat is nice to look at, but poorly thought through mechanicswise. The smallest startervessels (corvettes) can gain evasion stats high enough to kill off the ""strongest"" ships you can buy (battleships). Although you have invested thousands of minerals and research resources into upgrading space ports, researching battleship technologies, your starter ships are in the end even better. What about the different weapons you can research? As of now, it looks like the differences are minimal. Whether you use lasers or missiles or plasma or tiny little space amoeba doesn't matter. Whether you win depends on the size of your fleet (armypower) and whether you chose the big ships(bad decision) or the small starter ships (superior choice). If your strong fleet uses missiles or lasers or both - it ends up not making much of a difference (I have redesign and built various fleets now without noticable impact on fights.)
- Many grandstrategy mechanics are missing. No spionage, no trade routes, no assassination, no foreign influence mechanics (like causing rebellions on the enemy side).
- There is good hope that starting now you will enjoy stellaris more and more with future dlcs where new mechanics might be added and mods coming up (Imagine a mass effect grand strategy game)			"
281990,76561198006120543,0,0,0,True,36.9,May 15,"Stellaris succesfully delivers in depth strategy whilst promosing a unique experience in every game. Like all Paradox Interactive games, the mechanics present challenging and fun features that open up so many possibilities and customise the game around your interests and desires. Ive been a fan of games like Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis for some time and have always been a fan of 4x sci fi games. 
The only constructive feedback I have is that the game could include more in-depth features like in EU4, and perhaps more customisation with how your empire expands/matures. However, Im sure features like this will be included through patches, DLC's and expansions. Also, the game would benefit if additional features were added to the UI, for example, different ways of seeing the world; similar to EU4's different map modes.
For me, Stellaris is a merging of classic Paradox Games with games like Sins of a Solar Empire and board games like Eclipse. Be warned, you will spend all your time building and expanding your empire. When the day finally comes when you have won, you can start all over again with a different empire and different maps, along with overhaul mods, DLC's and expansions.
Overall, Stellaris is a fantastic game which always delivers a unique experience. I highly recommend it.			"

If you generally like 4x space games, and have also enjoyed Paradox games like EU4 you'll probably find a lot to like here. The exploration is exciting, the technology and quest chains provide a lot of flavor, and the end-game scenarios have a lot of potential.
1 week after launch though you may want to hold off for a few patches or the 1st DLC.  There are a number of quality of life mapmodes and tools PDX should add (roster of potentially colonizable planets, mapmodes that overlay alliances, more automated options for ships), the AI needs a moderate amount of tweaking in a number of areas, combat/wars need tweaking, the mid-game feels slow compared to the beginning/end (it's about the same as a lot of4x games though- it's more than the opening and end game are just much better), and areas of diplomacy and economics are very bare-bones at release.

Paradox has made another immersive, intrigruing and downright fun game to play with. Ironman mode is an option(one I would highly recommend, for immersions sake) and each game feels different and unique. I have not reached late game yet but I really enjoy the way this game is building up to it.
Pros
1. Management is as advanced as you want it to be. You can minmax down to specific scientists for specific research jobs, specific generals for specific fleet types, specific governors for specific colonies.
2. Combat is interesting and diverse. There are different weapon types, different modifications to these weapon types, and you can fully customize and design the ships in your fleet. It's like a simplified version of building ships in EVE online, where you want to design fleets that do one job and do it really well.
3. Diplomacy is a thing. You can be diplomatic and peace-loving, you can also be war-hungry and aggressive. You may want to tune your plan depending on the neighbours you end up discovering around you. If you end up with a religious zealot focused on dominion and destruction, it may not be the wisest move to set yourself up for a slow methodical start. Unless you make friends, that is.
Cons
I have yet to find any real cons. I was a little bummed out when my main leader died, but that's the price of mortality I guess. There are genetic research you can do to expend lifespans, and it wouldn't surprise me if there is some biotechnology research you can do as well. We shall see, this game is still an adventure I'm discovering.			"
281990,76561198006609425,0,0,0,True,33.0,May 10,"So, I’m liking the game but I am unsure if it is my love for this style of game or the game itself I’m loving.  I can say I feel there were a few missed opportunities.  I’m a huge fan of CK2 and Imperium Galactica 2 (oh how I was hoping for a worthy successor).  I am enjoying the game thought so please don’t be discouraged.  Paradox has a record of improving games with mods/patches/DLC and stand by their titles.  So I’m not overly worried.
Stellaris offers what many of us have been missing in that it is real time 4x space strategy game.  Finally no more “end turn” right?  Freely customizable race, easy modding, and a nice arrangement of traits/characteristics allow for replay ability.  Keep an eye out for mods in workshop though as they will probably be able to take the vanilla game further in its current state.
Diplomacy could use some work.  Coming from an experience like CK2 where there is such a detailed level of advisors, intrigue, relationships, etc.… you will be underwhelmed by the diplomacy.  Like no joke, there’s not much to it…  
Planets…  So I am not sure if I am for or against this rather dated style of planet/colony management.  It reminds me of Master of Orion where planets have tiles which can be modified to produce a resource based off the building.  It works for the game so I have no real complaints on it, just seems like an old mechanic that we have seen before.  Something I’m not too fond of is the planet control system and how your kind a forced to give up control of your systems to a governor after you a mass a few colonies.  I suppose if there was more interaction or even the feeling that I was handing over my territory to someone of value it wouldn’t be so bad.  However, it feels quite static.  Made me miss CK2 and long for those intriguing back stabbing plots to break away or declare independence from my rule.  There is little you can do to control how you want your sectors run and leaders again are quite static.  Not to mention limited in availability.  Don’t expect to have scientist, generals, admirals, and leaders everywhere or even in all the above areas.
So combat is indeed 4x, but doesn’t really feel like it.  More or less move one fleet onto an enemy fleet and they swarm around firing.  No direct player control.  Again, not a complaint, it works.  And the UI window on battles during and after offers more details to help redesign your ships versus CK2 UI.  Sadly I feel the 4x component is wasted in this though…
Overall the game is very vanilla, like not even vanilla bean, or vanilla with sprinkles….it’s just vanilla.  However, mods and time will tell if Paradox adds to it and brings us the enjoyment we have seen in other titles (CK2) (I mention CK2 because I’d so die happy for a CK2 in space type game).  I am enjoying it though and have already logged many hours since its release here.  
I will leave you with this thought…  Recall back to the early days of CK2 and how it was at first launch, or even some other titles…  I’m just looking towards the future and ready to reach for my pocket book for the plethora of DLC to come.  :)

Though I haven't played much yet, as the game has just been released, I'm pretty sure stellaris will be among those few games. It's already a great game, very polished, I haven't encountered a single bug yet, wonderful UI, feature rich, with deep yet not overwhelming gameplay,  a game casual gamers will love as well as hardcore ones. Paradox has created a masterpiece, and with the continuing support, improvements and expansions, the game will grow even better. In any case, I think it's going to be the new reference point in this genre, for any new game made in the (not so near) future. Highly recommended.			"

Just the initial race creation process demonstrates the amount of thought and attention that's gone into every aspect of the game. Even the early stages of the game avoid becoming a tedious grind through the inclusion of random events such as (in the case of my first game) a group of separatist cultists and a variety of space-born megafauna!
As I play and experience more of the game I'll add to this review but as it stands I would encourage any fan of grand strategy and empire building to pick this up - when mods (and presumably the inevitable expansions) start to rollout I can see the lifespan of the game extending for years.			"

A fully in-depth and well integrated tutorial?? You don't do those Paradox!
A soundtrack and audio effects that suck you in and are incredibly enjoyable? You don't do those either Paradox!
A polished presentation with easy to read menus and interfaces? Well... sometimes you kinda do that Paradox.

This is the change that we need in this genre, no more boring bland 4x space games. But something exicting, every game meet new alien species and explore a new galaxy full of wonders. No more colonizing every planet you find just because you can, but the thrill to find a awesome planet you can colonize. The ability to enslave whole populations. A galaxy that is big and beautifull with an awesome sound track backing it up.
I can write walls of texts about how great this game is, it sure has some flaws and has alot of potential to be fleshed out with DLC. But for now I rather focus on conquering the galaxy.

281990,sokanastenev,0,0,0,True,25.7,May 10,"Pros
- Enjoyable early stage gameplay
- Race Creator is cool
- Tech Tree is unique and interesting
- Solid performance with exception
Cons
- Currently considerably sterile and lacking in any great amount of content
- That there grind though; but somewhat understandable I guess
- Diplomacy and Subterfuge are flat
- Trade doesn't really exist
- The daily stuttering bug on larger maps. Only Tiny seems to work well, despite only using a maximum of 65% of my CPU
Was it worth the ~$70(AUD), I dunno I'm on the fence; as with any Paradox title the bugs will be fixed and content will be added (in the form of detestable DLC) so there is room for improvement and maybe improved customer satisfaction.
Gameplay is typical 4X, if you like it you like it otherwise you won't enjoy the game much. The ability to populate the world with species and cultures of your own making is great and the tech tree has been implemented in an intriguing manner.
But the apparent lack of content and that damned stuttering bug is a nuisence, but the Paradox rep(s) seem adament about pushing the point that a patch is coming (bug should've been visible in testing if they used a mix of hardware from different vendors for comprehensive QA). 
The gem of a Paradox 4x is generally the diplomatic actions that can be used to coerce opponents in a game of skullduggery and politics. This game has the diplomatic depth of Donald Trump.
Stutter bug is game breakingly annoying and occurs on all but the smallest map size, patch is incoming but this should've been caught during the quality assurance phase, but it didn't and now we wait for 1000 world map sizes. Stutterbug aside the game runs solidly.
7/10 pending 8/10 once the stutter gets fixed.			"
281990,emp456,0,0,0,True,36.6,May 9,"I was just going to test this for a while but somehow i played almost 4 hours. And i need to eat, and i need to sleep, and i need to work...
My first impressions: this is a great, great game. It's not perfect, but if you like space strategy games, you need to play this.
Summary: a must have for a strategy fan. I don't like scores, too subjectives, but this is at least more than 8,5 and less than 10 out of 10.
Playing on: Win 7 64 SP1, i-7 4770, GTX980, 16GB RAM.
Liked:
-Stable, no bugs encountered, 0 problems so far.
-UI is much more polished, easy and beautiful than other Paradox games (EU games, CK games)
-Tutorial is fantastic, this is not Europa Universalis ""tutorials"" or ""scenario tutorial"", they have put a good work here (and it works...not like that scenario tuto from EU IV)
-Graphics are really beautiful and you can zoom in and out to see your stations or ships or even a planet just as icons or with a lot of detail. If you zoom all in to a ship, it will you remember Eve Online (less details, and ofc only if you have seen that game)
-Background music is nice, and some parts/songs are fantastic for a space game. I played all 4 hours with music on and i will continue to listen to it while i play, no doubt.
-Galaxy is HUGE. You can select a few options here to generate, but the maximum is 1000 stars. Yes, 1000. And maybe 5 times more with mods (but no mods yet, ofc lol) 1000 stars is crazy, and also fantastic for a Marathon game!
-Lot of customization options: races, planets, techs, names (you can name almost all in game, your stations, your ships, your planets and your leaders) I have seen no option for selecting the AI races in the game, maybe that option is not there.
-Lots of technologies divided in 3 main branches: physics, society and engineering and you need a scientist leader for each branch. They said about 300 techs in total, that's a good amount and i'm sure they will add more in future development.
-Resources and anomalies (events, more or less) to discover in the galaxy and some anomalies (events) lead you to a series of missions that you can do for some extra resources, techs and maybe more, i don't know yet.
-A nice ships editor where you can create your own ships with modular components that first you need to research, obviously. You can select different ""bodies"" for the specific ship you want to create that let's you add more small weapon mounts, or more medium mounts, or more slots for services, etc. If you are creating a service ship (like a colony one) you'll want more modules to put some extras, but if you want just a big ship to do damage, then you'll want the body that has more weapon slots. Each body has different visual little details that you can observe when zooming.
-I tried with 3 languages i know (more or less lol English, Spanish and French) and translations are vey good.
-Addictive and fun.
Disliked:
-There are no report screens for the income and expenses. You can pass the mouse over resources and a popup will tell you what are you expending in total (for instance, 50 credits in stations) but there is no extensive report to see exactly where are you expending to better manage your incomes. This is a basic in every strategic game and it's strange that Stellaris don't have better reports and more info.
-Apparently, you cannot create your stations like the rest of the ships. You can build one with a construction ship and then add modules for a military stations, but cannot modify scientific and mining ones.
-Just 2 win options: own 40% of the systems or kill/conquer all the other races. I'm sure they will add more (with a DLC? i hope no)
-Needs more visual customization for races and to distinguish one empire from other, apart of color of ships and flag icon (portraits of individuals at least). You can play againts 36 AI enemies, but there are just 6 species groups and one you have seen a molluscoid, you have seen they all. But, of course, this will come with DLC's.
-This game is going to steal a lot of time from my rest.
In summary, a must have for any fan of strategy. Fantastic.			"

Before I go on, know that there are some issues with the game as it is now. Late game ends up a bit lacking, and the interface needs some work. Diplomatic communication and AI needs a small upgrade too. 
BUT, don't think the game is unplayable if these things worry you. If you pick up this game, my advice to you, is grab your favorite sci-fi, and roleplay it. This game is unprecedented on the feeling it gives you as the leader of your empire. It IS your empire, and it IS your guys that are being badass. 
It's kinda hard to put it in words, but you are going to end up immersed and that familiar ""One more turn"" feeling that sucks you down the rabbit hole, will hit you HARD. 
As it is now, this game is one of my all time favorites, right up there with the classics, and it's only going to get better. Paradox has always had extensive support with updates and fantastic DLC after launch. And you can mod this game with the same fervor you mod Skyrim, just waiting on those total conversion mods, yum. 
So yes. Recommended with high marks.

At first start up, the game can be a bit overwhelming, but if you are experienced in strategy games, it will come to you fairly quickly, if you aren't, the tutorial does an excellent job introducing you to the mechanics. There is so much flavor and depth to every part of this game that makes it fresh and enjoyable every single playthrough. Exploration, diplomacy, and good management of your entire empire is the key to success, as well as being extremely compelling to do. Whether it is going to war and enslaving the four-eyed hawk people, or discovering an anomaly only to find out that it is a ceramic pot in close orbit to a star, this game is fantastic. Typically, i would warn people off the price point, as 40$ can be pretty steep, but of all the strategy games out their, this one is the one that i believe to be worth that money.

Stellaris looks great, got a perfectly paced gameplay (pretty slow development, rushing isnt a thing here), has a awesome soundtrack and tons of different sidequests, storys and hidden secrets to discover. Of course it got some flaws like the lack of different ships or the sometimes strangely acting AI, but those are just minor complaints imo. 
In the end, Stellaris is a great game and I enjoy every single second of it!			"
281990,starspangledclown,0,0,0,True,124.1,May 15,"The game overall is extremely good, judging by the 113.5 hours I have logged in the first WEEK of the game being released. That being said, you will enjoy this game until you have to declare war on someone. 
The warscore system is genuinely the worst war system I've ever seen in a 4x game, and I play A LOT of 4x games. 
The game forces you to create ""war goals"" which at first glance make sense, until you realize that you can only capture a few PLANETS (not systems) at a time, or form a protectorate over the enemy. You CANNOT just sweep in on a declaration of war and eliminate/capture an entire empire in one swoop. You have to ""liberate"" or capture three or so at a time, and then accept peace. Wait like 10-20 years, and THEN declare war again, but usually that just turns everyone against you. 
So for a game that says it gives you the freedom to create whatever kind of empire you want, it's true on that part. But what it fails to deliver on, is allowing you to actually carry that out. If you want to create an empire that is hell-bent on capturing and destroying everyone, you can create that, but once you have to actually begin taking over systems and empires, be ready to break out some painkillers for the massive headache that is the warscore system.
Additionally,  most everything else people say is true. The UI can screw you over at times, and if it does it REALLY screws you over, but in my experience that has been very few and far between, if at all. The Federation system to me doesn't totally make sense, since I don't really see the benefit in forming one. (Not in a philosophical sense, but a gameplay sense. I don't see any in-game benefit with forming a federation anyway. Just more reason to pull out the painkillers.
To sum this game up, you WILL thoroughly enjoy this. Paradox has yet again created a stellar 4x game that again sets the standard for other companies to live up to. This is the way 4x games should be made. Like I said, I play a lot of 4x, including the complicated micro-managing ultimate 4x simulator Distant Worlds: Universe. This game is just a lot more fun to play. DW: U might be more of the ""classic 4x"" game, but Stellaris is a game you can jump into every single time and enjoy your playtime.

+Avaliable tech is semi-random (with specific limitations), meaning there isn't always the same optimal path for every stage of the game.
+A single playthrough will take a significant amount of time, a supurb time sink. (could also be a negative for some)
+Crusading Space Mushrooms!
However the game isn't without it's issues.
-Late game performance with 800 stars could be better.
-The AI could use some work with sensible building choices, I'm referring to sector AI in particular. If CPU usage is a concern maybe one solution could be to limit resource allocation once you reach a certain number of planets/sectors, as it's honestly more of a relevant problem in the early/mid game as opposed to later on.
-The victory conditions leave something to be desired. I honestly can't decide whether the problem is a lack of variety in the victories, or the idea that they exist at all. Regardless, I really feel like it should be more fleshed out overall, in one direction or another.
-The diplomacy could use some work, during my last game the only way I could aquire allies was by creating vassals. Nothing like forced friends!
Stellaris is quite a good game, if a bit short on content. I enjoy the game, and I'd also recommend it. If you're concerned then wait for some patches and the inevitable dlc, see how the game develops.			"

They're my favorite genre, I adore Distant Worlds: Universe, Galactic Civilizations 2, Endless Space.. But I have to say, Stellaris tops them all. The depth and feel of this game are just absolutely perfect, it's everything I've always wanted from a 4x game. I've put over a thousand hours into Civilzation V and I don't see myself going back to that anytime soon now that I have Stellaris to scratch my itch.
This game released five days ago, and I've already put 79 hours in.. Mostly single player, but probably 20 hours multiplayer. Single player and multiplayer are both fantastic. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

At this time i would give it a 7/10 but confident that it will ony get better from here			"
281990,-aero-,0,0,0,True,45.8,May 15,"Really fun game that shows a lot of promise. Like other Paradox games, especially with a scale and scope this large - it will take time to formulate a more complete package of a game. There is a lot of things that Paradox talked about developing and wanting to put into the game prior to the release that didn't make in time, but they are still pushing development to get stuff added.
Ultimately, this is a strategy game that really is primarily a 4x space game with a lot of grand strategy empire elements. It is focusing on the macro, not the micro of the genre. I'm a huge fan of strategy games and 4x games, but this one offers a different spin on the genre than most genre contenders try to achieve. The population system and some of the more grandoise gameplay elements for governing, sectors, species, etc., are all really great gameplay systems. The best part is that they are things that can be added to and improved over the game's life.
It has been a very long time since I couldn't stop playing a game like with Stellaris. Started a new campaign and before I know it I open the Steam in-game UI and boom : 600 minutes session. Just like Civ 5 or a plethora of other games, it will suck the life out of you. It's so easy to just keep playing. 
The UI, tutorials, and quite frankly how the game starts is set up in a way that is ideal for a new player and a veteran player. You start with one system and one planet, and move on up the galactic ladder from there. It's a great way to slowly get acclimated to the game's systems and the space around your home planet. The early game is really strong and the anomalies/exploration is top notch. There's some great storytelling and flavor text to be had here, and as you slowly expand your borders you have a great time doing so.
Mid-game is fun too and when it starts to shift towards more of a grand strategy / complete 4x game and starts to shy away a bit from the exploration focused early game. Late-game is awesome, but as it currently stands it does feel a bit dull compared to the early and mid-game. Content dries up a bit and it becomes the biggest factions versus the biggest factions and winner take all. I guarantee Paradox will be adding some life to the later stages of the game with updates and DLC though, just like with all of their titles.
I'm really happy with this game and I think any fan of the 4x genre or just strategy games in general will have a good time. In fact, even fans of space/sci-fi stuff should have a good time too because there's a lot of immersion to be had. It's a great game for roleplaying an empire, and I've spent a good couple hours just building empires to my liking. 
Overall, probably a 9/10 for me. This could easily be one of the best 4x games ever made after some updates and content additions are incorporated. Honestly, as much as DLC gets a lot of flak in the community -- this is a game I'd gladly buy DLC for because I know it will be worth it. There's countless hours of exploring the stars to be had here. I am cautiously optimistic that I'd give this game a 9.5/10 or 10/10 once more content gets added. But even as it stands now it is worth the admission.
What are you waiting for?
Also as a side note, I just uplifed Cockroaches on the nuclear wasteland Earth I just found in my game into academics. Now my Cockroaches stock my research buildings on colonies. The spirit of humanity in my campaign may have died on Earth by blowing themselves up, but the cockroaches carry on the mantle of Sol in my empire. Unfortuantely a specific colony had a mutant Cockroach genetic dispartiy, and they became really dumb. No matter, the Super-Cockroach are now my frontline warriors for ground troops when I siege planets. Now... I'm just trying to push towards electing a Cockroach president.			"
281990,76561198089808820,0,0,0,True,126.3,May 15,"when it comes to grand space strategy, it is between this and GalCivIII.  I would say that Stellaris beats GalCivIII in most departments, except that the AI in GalCivIII is more interactive, and therefore more conducive to 'strategization'. I found in Stellaris that I spent all of my time micro-managing a growing 'empire', never interacting with AI to any real satisfactory level, and the war and conquest system seemed totally anti-climactic considering all the micromanagement investment.
But I still played it for 4 days straight.
Once they include spy networks, trading networks, a generally more advanced and aggressive AI, and maybe more winning conditions, then you could say that Stellaris has definitively overtakn GalCivIII in grand space strategy.
I will just have to wait until then to play it again.			"
281990,niarbeht,0,0,0,True,100.6,May 15,"Overall, a great game even at this point.  There are, however, some missing features that would make sense.  For example, one can place worlds into ""Sectors"" for the AI to manage for you, which is great for when you've already built a world up the way you want it.  However, after you've built a sector, you're completely unable to interfere in it without taking the world you need to ""fix"" out of the sector.  Further, the game punishes you if you go over a limit on your directly managed planets, thus meaning that if your sector AI is doing something stupid (see holding on to Betharian Power Plants when there's no Betharian Stone for them to consume), you have to eject the planet from the sector, fix the problem, then add it back in again.  Why?  Why make me go through so many steps to fix the AI being stupid?
Further, AI-controlled empires seem to be... braindead, sometimes.  For example, if robotic rebellions have begun, and the Machine Intelligence has started to spread, AI empires that could EASILY re-take their lost worlds will make no attempt to.  In one game, I followed a strategy of waiting for the Machine Intelligence to spread into my opponents, then just following behind their advance, taking worlds from the Machine Intelligence.  The AI empires could easily have fought back, but instead I was gaining significant territory against my opponents... by letting the computer player beat the computer players.  Iron-y?
Well, it's Paradox, and they do tend to support their grand strategy games, so I figure it'll all be ironed out.			"

The gameplay itself captures quiet solitude and shattering revelation. This game plays like the best episodes of Star Trek, the ones that make you feel quiet and small at the end. Every time you feel big and in control, you discover something new to make you feel insignificant again.
The game isn't perfect. It feels like the living project it is. It will get better over time, and some of the pacing inconsistencies and bothersome closeness of the midgame will get worked out. 
But this game is already responsible for two of my favorite gaming moments of the year. Spoilers ahead:
1. The first time I came across an alien species. My science ship scrambled. I looked for stats or a description, or something to make me feel better. All I saw was a big scary number that was way bigger than my fleet could handle, and a big quesiton mark. And it was just sitting there, watching me, and then it disappeared. I wanted so badly to know what it was, and I was so excited to read about it when I finished that research project.
2. I was in steady mid-game stride. I had met all my neighbors, formed and aliance and some rivalries. I was in control, and building at a rate that would launch me past my rivals very soon. I sent a science ship out to explore the far side of the galaxy. And it suddenly disappeared. I paused and went looking for it. The last system it was in was a star with no planets, just a giant ring around the star. No sign of my ship. I unpaused, and a transmission comes in from one very angry, xenophobic fungus. His empire was larger, more powerful, and more ancient than I could comprehend, and he didn't like me one bit. 
So no matter what else happens with this game, I want to thank Paradox for those two amazing moments. Those alone were worth the game price.			"

The ai is fairly good. In war, the convintionial fleet warfare it is quite good. However it is quite poor at coordinating with its allies in the sense of not defending the not most powerful ally's territory, but its very good with its allies in the sense of presenting a unified front. It doesn't seem to understand how to fight a war of attrition, and it is horrible at ground combat, attacking and defending. It also struggles with certain alternitive styles of warfare that a player can use like guarlia style, which I've used to great sucess winning the three wars I tried it in where I was reasoniable outmatched and couldn't win in a direct fight. Fleet battles themselves are a bit bugged like if one side fully retreats then no one wins or losses, as far as warscore is concerned. In ai diplomacy it's well done; it's much like EU4. The ai is perphaps not agrressive enough, but I blame that mostly on most alien civs being peaceful kinds of governments. The ai seems to be very good at exsploring. Its seems to be resoniable at managing resource tiles. The  ia isn't agressive enough at colonaision. It is very good at ship design, but almost all the aliens I fought didn't have as many ships as they should of have, but they were mostly federation builders personialies or something similiar. Big bug right now is slavery is broken in the sense that slaves will never revolt. I also found an odd bug in that if you are invading a planet, then in the middle of the battle before can retreat, you end the war and they keep the planet you were attacking your troops will disapear. but the gamewill still think they are the planet so you can always see the planet even though nothing of yours is there. Despite its problems I still say you should play it; most bugs are anoying, but none are game breaking*. * well some are, but they either fix themselves over game time or a reload fixes them. 
To sumarize at this point its a good grand statagy game, up there with CK2 and EU4, but it is bad 4x game. Its more a 4x lite, grand statagy is the main. I say ignore the victory goals, make your own, its much better that way. Roleplaying in it is very fun like in CK2, however you for the most part don't have to do stupid things for roleplay. Its like EU4, but not as cut throat. Its half of each in space with its own uquine elements with the potentionial to become the best grand statagy. Right I say its the best grand stategy in space, after all there arn't very many, most are mainly 4x.			"

There is something in this game that makes you wanna play ""just another turn"". The problem is - this game is not turn-based.

This game is extremely fun while just starting alone, but once you meet other players and truly start playing multi - you get a nice +150% fun and -200% boredom passive bonus.

Original review written at 60 hours. Edited at 140 hours.
The good:
Nice expansive scope and high polish. You can uplift species to give them sentience; you can enlighten already-sentient aliens that haven't hit the FTL stage; the diplomacy feels very above-average to me, though it's not something I tend to pay much attention to unless something bugs me; and there are stagnant empires of high-tech aliens that came before you. That makes the universe feel very lived-in, which is very nice. The tech trees are pretty deep, and semi-random for replayability. The race/empire creation has a lot of choices. The fun factor is high - I've got about 140 hours in at the time of this writing.
The bad:
Ludicrous numbers of bugs. I started keeping a notepad near my keyboard to jot down bugs I found. I gave up when I had to start a second page. From a QA point of view, the game is a hot mess. That being said, however, none of the bugs are game breaking. I have never had to restart because of a bug. The closest I came was an ironman game that lost 50 years of progress (so I don't play ironman anymore; I just manually choose not to save scum). That may mean more to you if you're a cheevo hunter, since you only unlock achievements when playing ironman.
Conclusion:
I really love this game. It's apparent that a lot of thought went into designing how the systems would work and fit together with each other. It's pretty obvious that the development was rushed and a lot of QA got dropped, but nowadays that's not as big an issue as it was back pre-internet. I would imagine their desire to sell DLC will prompt them to go back and finish the job. After all, I'm not very likely to buy DLC if the base product isn't finished. Even at 90% complete, however, the game is a gem :o)			"

This game has just about everything you could want; exploration, diplomacy, war, trade; and all in SPACE!
The beginning of the game is very much exploration and expansion, how long this lasts depends on how many other civilizations you start with.  Once you start meeting them the mid game starts and you need to decide if you are going to become bigger through diplomacy or war.  And then once you think you are powerful to take on the fallen empires (once galaxy rulers) even greater threats appear.
Overall this is an absolutely amazing game and I recommend it to all that are interested in the strategy genre.  In fact it is probably the best game to get into Paradox's Grand Strategy games as the exploration and expansion ease you into the diplomacy and war.
This is just single player.  Multiplayer I'd have to say is the best of any Paradox game I have played.  No desync issues, just slowing of the game in major battles.			"

The biggest Pro for me?  It was easy to get into even though I have played only ""casual"" strategy games such as Civ 5 and more RTS style games such as starcraft.  I felt overwhelmed only for a few moments when things began happening, but as long as you read / listen to the helpful robot you will get the hang of it quickly.
It is worth noting there is a LOT to do in this game but the majority of it is entertaining and none of it felt completely like a chore.  If you do not take interest in building each little planet hand-by-hand you can even set it inside of a zone that takes care of it for you (at least after the first few hours when the tutorial takes you there).

Well, I liked it so much that I bought two copies, and sent the other to a friend.
As a longtime fan and player of MOO2, I was not at all pleased with the latest iteration of the aforementioned game, so when I found Stellaris it was a godsend. It takes everything you want from a grand space strategy and, in most cases, gives you more.
Breakdown:
Pros:
- Surprisingly deep roleplaying
- Gorgeous UI
- Pleasing variety of species
- Complex diplomacy
- Very strong early game
- 8/8 mod support
- Lots of room for DLC
Cons:
- Too much information
- HORRIBLE AI
- Forced automation of planets
- Boring Diplomacy
- Uninteresting war
- Lots of room for DLC
Nitty Gritty:
For starters, the game forces you to play rather specifically to the personality of your race; the availability of many options, and the viability of others, will be determined by your race's beliefs. Furthermore leaders can die during battle, via dangerous research or simply from old age, and don't be surprised if you get attached to a few (especially if you made your own name-generation list). This makes the game more than about simply conquering the galaxy- you're conquering the galaxy for your empire, which is pretty different from everyone else’s.
Also, the UI is nicely put together and pretty easy to grasp. The crippling confusion you feel minutes into the game will pass, and the tutorial helps somewhat. Stellaris manages to be both very accessible and yet still give us a significant amount of depth.
On the not so good side, my biggest complaint is that the AI is horrendous. As in a ""dear-god-I-miss-AOE2-AI"" kind of horrendous. Your allies’ fleets will simply follows yours around, leaving their systems vulerable and their armies relatively inert, and you’ll be playing cat and mouse with your enemies during every war, as they are unwilling to engage unless victory is assured. I also might add that none of the computers seem inclined to address GALAXY WIDE THREATS. Finally the computers just… leave you alone. Seriously. I’ve yet to fight a war that I didn’t start myself.
The another major complaint is that every bit of information is on display to you. How strong an enemy fleet is. Whether your federation will agree to go to war or not. If a trade proposal will be accepted. This inundation of cold, hard numbers underlying every interaction definitely take away some of the thrill and suspense of, well, everything. Because of it, I always fight battles I know I’ll win, always make the best possible trades and am never left wondering about my place in the galaxy. Once you’re done exploring and have made your mark, things can get pretty dull and systematic very fast.
Both of these issues are somewhat solved by multiplayer though. Which is why I bought two copies.
Finally, an issue of some controversy, is the forced automation of your colonies. Most empires can only control 5 planets at a time before they start suffering penalties until they automate their systems in ""sectors"". This is designed to keep the game from becoming a micro-managing nightmare, which is good. In fact, I love this feature. However, even as someone who really despises micromanagement in 4x games it does bother me that the game effectively forces your hand with this. So if you (for some reason) like spending the majority of the game paused while reorganizing the attributes of dozens of planets... well, you'll be disappointed.
I know I have a lot of negative up there, but the truth is, it’s a fantastic game and I think everyone should play it. With updates, mods, and DLC the game will become even better, but for now it's a plenty solid game on its own.

The attention to detail in this game is rich and full of promise with throwing me back to memories of Sins of a Solar Empire with the empire construction and ship movement from system to system. Then we have the battles which give similar good times and are quite indepth if you need to defend multiple systems at a time, not lacking in tactical moves you could pull on an unsuspecting adversary.
Pros for me:
- Empire building is very well put together and I like the way a player can see just about anything they could want and change the little details for improvements
- Combat is excellent and gave me a challenge to hold off pirates, rouge aliens and other empires. Not clunky or full of complexity and simple to master once you have the basics down of how the game runs.
- The diplomacy and number of alien races you can have in one game is mind boggling but I like the idea of studying younger races than your own and uplifting them to the stars or genetically altering them to your needs.
- The size of the maps and games is immense with getting onto a 1000 star systems which I do like but multiplayer games I can see taking a long time to complete. Just how I like it. :)
- Last but not least is the ship building mechanic, this is very good and I like having the freedom to create more of what I would use in combat and exploration. Can create some nice weapon combos after you've reached a while and also a world class explorer.

281990,76561198047260054,0,0,0,True,81.5,May 15,"I highly recommend getting this game in its current state. Even with all the problems, its that good.
Its a paradox game, but it doesn't feel like a pradox game, because its not buggy on release and actually works. The tutorial is super, races are interesting, basically what was a DLC for other games is included in this one already (making your own custom race), and the music and atmosphere/graphics are all solid. Customizing the ships is cool, and the space battles can be fun to watch. The pops are complex and managing them can be interesting.
Problems:
1. AI is terrible. The enemies really don't understand how to win a war. In a game where all the AI countries start with pretty much the same resources (like in Civ), this leads to a situation where you as the player have a massive empire and everyone else has just divided up the galaxy evenly between them.
2. Fallen empires can be conquered, and all of their production facilities used by your pops. This is on top of the fact that defeating a fallen empire nets you their amazing super tech which puts your fleets light years ahead of your enemies in tech. Now, defeating them is no easy task, especially in the early/mid game, but its doable. They can't rebuild their fleets despite sitting on insane production, which makes conquering them too easy.
4. As far as I can tell, there is no benefit to having a balanced fleet with screens and cruisers protecting your BBs. In fact, they will die quickly as they go ahead of your BBs and get slaughtered waiting for them to catch up. There is no penalty for having an all BB fleet, and so you just end up building as many ships with the biggest guns you can get.
5. Leaders dying and science vessels having to research wreckage of your enemies gets annoying. More tasks need to be automated.
6. Putting fighter/bomber units on your ships doesn't work because the ships stay in the back and don't do anything.
7. The  ""zerg"" invasion is broken. It started off with a bang and fizzed quickly.
8. Designing the ships is cimbersome because there's no way to sort through the weapons and armor efficiently. 
Knowing paradox, I'm confident they will patch these problems in the next 5 or 10 years, so I'm sure it won't be a problem by the time you buy it.			"

As with any new game there is also a learning curve, but it is not very steep at all. The soundtrack is amazing and has kept me completely immersed in my space-fairing adventures. The tutorial however, while comprehensive. can be a bit annoying becuase it completely covers your list of what to do. That said the tutorial guide is quirky and can even bring out a few good chuckles. All in all from a beginners point of view, this game is great.

I just played thorugh the whole night on release day. It's extremely complex, demanding, customizable and communicative (played it in multiplayer). Unlike other games like Civilization 5 we had no constant leavers and if somebody looses connection the AI takes place (you can find that good or bad, but I think it's better than as if nothing would happen during the disconnect). Every player can also pause the game if he needs some more time, but it always felt fluent and sometime you'll be thankful for these short breaks. Stellaris involves many RPG elements in the sense of really taking place as the emperor of your realm. You are completely responsible for the executive commands, but your population has it's own will and you sometimes need to force yours on them. I'm not even a fan of real time strategy. I really prefer turn-based stuff, but this... it blew me away. Absolute must buy for people who see more in games than mundane entertainment, but deep gameplay mechanics, immersion and atmosphere. Due to the awesome modding capabilities (total conversions possible) we can look forward to a stunning amount of mods. Warhammer 40k with Stellaris mechanics?

for in a nutshell, scroll down!
First of all, i am kind of new to this gyme type.
I already owned Master of Orion (early access) and i must say this is imo a better choice.
whats good in Stellaris :
+ like the cusomization of ships and how its working in the game
+ its very fluid in gameplay
+ fancy graphic and artworks
+ easy to play & great intuitive inputs (shortcuts, etc)
+ it seems to offer a lot playtime
+ its not sooo expensive for such a huge contend filled game
whats not so good:
- the tutorial is okay, but wont answers you all your questions.
- very few things are not explained and you have (like i have right now) a hard time to find out what to do
(e.g. landing on planets, when the tooltip says ""no"" to you)
- 1000 planets is maximum and sounds much, but i was expecting more
- influence is kind of currency, but i think its a kind of blocker (it frustrates a lot when you cannot build something, etc)
Overall i must say, they have done many many things right and it feels like a very cool game.
I dont regret the buy and can recommend the game also to causal players like me.
As a professional, you might be also interested in Master of Orion, but i like this much more.
Thumbs up for a cool game !

281990,spritzen,0,0,0,True,52.0,May 15,"This has very quickly become my favorite 4x of all time. Most know how 4x works, so I'll just highlight what puts this on top for me. The only game that comes close to giving you that feeling of a immersive story in the 4x genre is Civ5 and that's partly down to the historical familiarity; this game achieves that without it and arguably better. They really have made the eXplore side of the game very intriguing, simply sending out a science vessal (scout) to each and every system you can, sounds labourious but it has you hanging with speculation and excitement. The diplomacy side of the game is unparrelled in the space 4x and it really is a welcome level of complexity brought in from their experience with their Europa series. I didn't think I'd like the realtime aspect as much as I do but it really fits well with this game, and I'm really looking forward to trying this out multiplayer because of it. Paradox being Paradox, we know their will be a wealth of DLC, and as much as many may hate that aspect, I'm personally really looking forward to it becuase there is so much growth potential in an already content rich game.

281990,76561198002450835,0,0,0,True,86.0,May 14,"It plays like the guys who made Crusader Kings made a MOO or Galactic Civ game, so no big surprises there. As in CK2, there's a lot of depth and interactive option and random events and pathways for the player and the game world to take. It's a time investment, for sure, to get the interface down (though it's much, much more streamlined than CK2 and the tutorial is good) and actually playing out the games isn't the most rapid of events, even if you speed things up.
It takes some of my favorite features from MOO2 and from CK2 and shoves them into one game, so I have a blast. Customizable and random alien races that you can modify and recruit into your populations are a heck of a lot of fun. I made a treaty with some otter people to allow migration between our worlds and ended up with some of their guys in my empire in my home world. These otter guys not only had some combat strength that my humans didn't have, but they prefered oceanic worlds to continental ones, so when I went to build a colony ship, I could fill it with otters if I so chose in order to better take advantage of different planets.
Declaring other nations as rivals in order to build political capital that you can spend is a neat concept. There seem to be enough diplomatic options to keep things interesting, though they tend to mostly fall along the standard lines in Civ, at least in the early game. Being able to take on (or even become!) a vassal is great and allows for a lot of flexible game play that CK2 opened up.
Being able to research along a few different paths at once is cool, as is being able to recruit and utilize different scientists' strengths for different projects is a neat layer. The fact that your governors, scientists, or military guys can become elected as your main leader adds a lot of flavor to the game (as does the fact that other nations swap out their leaders over time as well).
Exploration is fun, as the scientific vessels can find all sorts of neat things. The quest system that evolves over time is pretty neat, especially as it ties in to your findings and the leaders who get elected. It's at least as good as Endless Legend and much better than Beyond Earth.
It's involved, but for those looking for a deeper space strategy game should give this one a try.			"

I was blocked from leaving my alliance because they were busy with a distant war, so i was forced to watch as the menace ate the insides out of my neighbor.

This game seem to play out very much like Sins of a solar empire, except without the silly superpowers and abilities that the ships get and it's on a much more massive scale with more intricate 4x style empire management. What's great though is it doesn't have the 4x turn based play and is all real-time so you don't have hideously long wait times for a turn to happen. I thought that would be overwhelming at first as I suck at micro-management, but because you can tweak the speed whenever you like and pause things to issue commands it's all very friendly to the more casual players.
The diplomacy isn't completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like most of these empire management games, the AI actually seems to follow a set of logic and I've managed to make some friends.

Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan of moo/moo2 for decades and spent some hundreds of hours in gc2, and still I believe moo is the best in its genre... The thing is that stellaris is different in the most positive sense of this word. The grand strategy elements yet make you expect the depth and complexity you really want of it. The seemingly slow-paced sandbox feel of the early game is combined with the tension of getting acquainted with some nasty neighbors, and feeling the breath of those militaristic xenophobes 3 stars away from your borders makes you anxiously build military while you want to grow your planets, and science, and purge those amoebas preventing you from getting that sweet sweet gaia, and... It is something brand new in space strategy, and it is fantastic.			"

Started as a human (boring I know, I'll do better!)
First 20 years nothing interesting happens.
I meet my first neighbour, a fanatical purist. Thinks all life, except their own should die. They insult me right away.
For the next 50 or so years I keep getting insults and threaths.
Build my fleet, declare war on them, keep getting insulted.
Destroy their fleet, invade most of their systems. Still keep getting insults.
War last about 15 years. They accept defeat, I get 4 of their planets.
3 months pass still getting insults.
Would be insulted again 10/10.

The last strategy game I actually played was the beginning of the Total War series when I was young. I usually play FPS or MOBAs so me enjoying this game is saying a lot. This game is getting a lot of hype and the only real reason I bought it was because it is the #1 game on Top Sellers and I had 40$ to blow. The last game I bought for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles was ARK, and man was that like the crack to my needle. I think this game could be my new crack.
It took me my beginning 12 hours (yesterday)  to figure out why I had made 8 different races and why they had been annihilated. Whether your a prospective buyer of this game or just a new player reading reviews while you empire gets analed like mine I highly suggest to keep trying different things if you get frustrated with the anal.

It lives up to the standard of Paradox grand strategy games, and is one of the few that I would not mind paying for DLC. My only real gripes are that diplomacy seems fairly mechanistic and impersonal. I was really excited when my militant theocratic fox empire came into contact with a materialist plutocratic oligarchy, but nothing really came out of dialogue options. There's also not really that much variability, they could have done more with the species, and it's rather annoying having to mod name lists in when it would have been easy to just let you create a custom list. More CK-ish features such as dynamic portraits would have been awesome rather than just making all characters look the same besides minor differences. Like I said, it's one of the few games that I hope there will be DLC for, especially because of that reason.			"

My biggest thing is that you can choose from a few hundred planets to 1000 planets to explore, servey, colonize, scan, research, and mine. You can also choose how the galaxy is shaped. Alone with all of this, you can have up to 17 enemies and choose from over 30 alien life forms to conquor the known universe.
You can also choose from the pre-designed leader, or design your own and choose from a set of traits, skills, and even choose from pictures you would like your alien to look like, your planet to look like, even choose and design your own flag.
Combat is pretty straight forward, aim your ships to the target and the combat is automatic, although you can choose how you want your fleets to attack. This is also true for ground combat. The only downside is that you need to have a combat leader before you can setup a squad.
The only real issue you have to deal with (Although I like the idea) is that your leaders can age and grow old and finally die. This is something that is real and yet gives the game more additional strategy, so you can't just make a character and then hope for the best, you got to watch your characters as they progress through the game.
Overall a great strategy game where you have to watch everything and keep up with everything that is going on. Many really cool options to choose from and plenty of action going on even in the background.			"

I think Stellaris might be the best game that I've played. All the 4 X:s of eXploration, eXpansion, eXploitation, and eXtermination are fun. It got character and it got style, the small speeches by alien (and human) empires are well-written and colourful, that alien empires insult you if they find what you're doing bad is amusing and the AI behaves logically.
One bad thing. The game is buggy. This will improve soon, since Paradox are good at putting out patches in good time.

I am also not sure about the idea of sectors, at one point they might be great since we can have up 1k stars in the galaxy, but its not really smart and cuts our micro managment to up to 5 planets and our fleet (also they dont produce ships and we still have to do it, from our income!)

Once I figured the game out more my second try went much better. The game feels polished, there are no glaring glitches in the game. 
Be warned, if you are not interested in reading this is not the game for you! Nearly all information is given in the form of text and there are not many voice overs passed the tutorial sections. You will be presented with paragraphs to read. 
The tutorial system is kind of sub-par in my oppinion. Nothing is highlited during the tutorials, so some times finding where the tutorial wants you to click is difficult. There is no path for the tutorial, it kind of just puts you into a regualr game and gives you information as you click on new things with some very sugjested things to do. None of them are actually required to do when the tutorial promps you.

The mid-game is where things get a little bit stale, with the diplomacy and politics being rather shallow.

The game starts out much more like a civilization game than an EU game. You start with a singular solar system, scout you surroundings, meet enemies and neighbors, build mines to collect resources and send out colonists to expand your empire. Sounds familiar? You also develop technologies along a tech tree, have random events and kill pirates (think barbarians). Even the classification of your race (spiritual, industrious, militaristic, pacifistic ...) reminds me strongly of civ IVs classification of leaders.
Now, I am not saying this is civ in space. However playing stellaris to me has a lot more in common with said titles as any paradox title I know. It starts out pretty simple and straight forward. You start on your own and for the first years you are pretty much expanding without much trouble. After all, your competitors are more or less on your level of power, technology and resources. The amount of micro management grows proportionately to your empires size, which means after a while you'll be busy managing all those planets. Eventually you'll get into conflict with a neighbor who, depending on your play style, may have little more or less military power than you.
The point is, that this is a pretty fair game. Everyone starts the race more or less equal and your success largely depends on your system mastery. Even the fact that success is a thing (I dare you to define success in EU IV) makes a massive difference. There are traditional win states such as ""have the largest empire"" or ""kill everyone else"".
EU IV in contrast is a completely unfair game. Whether you start as mighty France or little Albania (if you're insane), the game is never balanced. Some nations are doomed from the beginning and making it to the year 1821 for them is a major achievement. Other nations might strive for world domination.
I like stellaris and I'm sure I'll get my money's worth out of it. But for me something is lost in the balanced race to supremacy. EU can be impenetrable with its interface and its complex systems. It can be cry out loud harsh when apparently out of nowhere an alliance rises against you. But setting my own goals, playing as a super power or a tiny monastery fighting against the odds is what keeps EU interesting to me. I don't see how stellaris can do the same.
I hope these impressions help to set expectations for the game correctly. I will update this text if I find that I was wrong or have further remarks.			"

The planet/sector management interface is sorely lacking in sorting options.  There is no interface to view potentially colonizable planets, and the only way to do so is by hovering over the galaxy map looing for green planet icons that disappear if you zoom too far out.
That said, the events and race designs are really well done, though the AI seems to balk at the eXpand portion of the 4x genre.  Almost 200 years into a playthrough there were still a LOT of habitable planets on the edge of the galaxy that were sitting uncolonized.  The endgame threats are cool though, and I'm looking forward to what the game will look like in 3-6 months with some TLC centered on the mid game lull and UI shortcomings.			"

Some of the issues I've noticed are:
-Mid game border clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s where you can't really interact with people you don't have a border with.  (Without getting military access to space that lies inbetween you, the devs have stated they are working on this.)
-Mediocre Ai that are great in some areas and terrible in others. (Ai are also too passive in some situations and highly predictable from a diplomatic POV.)
-Lack of any form of major diplomatic UI such as color coding alliances, Ai's opinion of other factions, ect.
-Too few victory conditions?  (This is more my personal opinion, just look at how many ways you can win in Civ)
-Lack of internal/external trading.
There are certainly a few more, but I believe these are the major points.
All in all, I've put nearly 60 hours into a game that was released just under 2 weeks ago.

Personally, I love the game.  It has (almost) everything I want in a 4x space game; heavy emphasis on early game exploration, event chains emulating my favorite sci-fi tropes, and big gnarly space ships blasting the crap out of each other. The domestic and foreign politics systems are a bit thin for what I was expecting from paradox, but I imagine that will flesh out in time.  Even stripped down, the government and diplomatic options are still far and away more sophisticated then the usual 4X space fare I've seen in the last 10 years (with the exception of Distant Worlds).  In fact, Stellaris reminds me of one of my favorite games from the 4x genre: the Space Empires series.  Just with updated graphics, real time / pause, and a dash of the usual paradox stuff.
Stellaris does what it does very well, and it's firmly rooted in the 4X genre.  If you are expecting it to be more complex and fiddly like other paradox titles, or a soap opera simulator like CK2....well it definitely isn't either of those things.  It has less in common w/ other paradox titles than it does with 4x games like Civ, Galactic Empires, or Endless Space.  The fussy micromanagement stuff isn't there yet, but it seems like more of the more complicated systems will be added over time with patches and expansions. 
The AI, whether working for you or against you, needs some work.  The sector system feels artificial and isn't especially well explained.  It doesn't feel organic.  The faction system feels bare bones.  Diplomacy does what you would expect from a 4x, but there could be more done with it.  From what I've seen combat systems could be expanded on, especially fighters/bombers and capital ship effectiveness.  
Even with that, I absolutely recommend the game for space fans, 4x fans, and strategy fans in general.  It hits just enough of the right notes to make me feel like I'm participating in a sci fi story of my own.  For me everything else is just details.			"
281990,76561198078492212,0,0,0,True,72.7,May 18,"Stellaris is a grand strategy game mixed with 4x elements. Like Paradox' other titles, this game is made with a lot of love and attention to detail, while still providing a fun gameplay experience with almost infinite replayablity. The personal empire creation and expansion gives the player the perfect pioneer feeling, while the mid-game politics aspects turn the game into a whole new experience. 
Mentionable features are the alien race creation with its ethics and the indept ship customization. 
Yet, there are stilll some flaws with it. while other paradox titles give you great and well positioned information, once the player got to know the interface, stellaris lacks this comfort. Here you have to do perform 2-5 clicks more to find the info you need. in the mid to late game, the game tends to lag in big universes, even with a decent pc (gtx 980, i5 4690k, 16GB RAM), which makes it less enjoyable.
All in all, this game is totally worth your money, if you like strategy games. it is, in contrast to other paradox titles, very easy to get into, yet lets you improve your skills each time you try a new start. If you are looking for a space exploration and politics game, there are no better alternatives than this!			"

281990,gothicusfreakyus,0,0,0,True,233.1,May 20,"Stellaris is more than just a 4x game, its also more than just a grand strategy game. itâ€™s a game about creating stories and it does it exceedingly well.
My first serious playthrough I was leading an empire of weak (recently psychic) bug aliens on their slow expansion across the vastness of space, my enemies the evil mushrooms and their avian lapdogs had carved a deep chunk out of my borders quickly overcoming my hilarously inadequate defences before being beaten back by my hastily scavenged together fleet headed by an ancient salvaged cruiser I had pressed back into service.
I was desperate, no one wanted to help my beleaguered empire and my galactic neighbours all sat there waiting to carve up my territory once my enemies finished me off.
Salvation came from an unlikely source. A world of primitives on the very edge of my territory were impressive warriors, they were backwards and horribly violent caught up in a global conflict and just starting to harness the power of the atom but they would make excellent cannon fodder to throw against my slimy foes.
So I infiltrated this unremarkable world, an insignificant planet in the Sol system the locals called Earth and began preparing them for subjugation. Time ground past slowly with my beleaguered fleet holding even but my inept ground troops unable to make any headway on retaking my planets. My gains were slow but steady,  I had a brief moment of terror when my infiltration was almost discovered but finally the human race bowed down in welcome of their liberators who had lifted them from barbarismâ€¦ and enslaved the entire race of weird mammals five minutes after the cheering died down.
That little story is stellaris in a nutshell and its only one of an infinite number of stories the game helps you to create.
Its not perfect, it slows in the mid game and it could do with a few tweaks and fixes but what game doesnâ€™t these days? Stellaris is designed to be modded altered and changed to the desires of its players, if you donâ€™t like something not only does the company support you fixing it to your liking they will be more than happy to show you how.
I look forward to added content as the game evolves, both from the developers and the fanbase, I have a feeling Stellaris will be telling me new stories for years to come.			"

So many possibilities for how you can play so I just keep restarting to try things out. Sure there are a few buggy things here and there, and definitely a number of things where you go ""boy I wish this was a feature"" but if you look at any other Paradox game (I've only played V2 and CK2 well after they were released) there should be a ton of DLC to add even more. Only major downside is that the UI gets kinda small on larger screens. My resolution is at 2160x1440 and I have to get pretty close to see it super well. But this just seems to be a Paradox issue. Not game breaking, but more of a quality of life problem.

I've played nearly all of the 4X space games - MoO 1 and 2 and 3, GalCiv, Sword of the Stars, Sins of a Solar Empire, and none of them stack up like Stellaris does.  I consider Master of Orion 2 to be the high-water mark of 4X games, and Stellaris definitely lives up to that legacy.
I'm still in my first game, playing a pretty standard human-type race with a military oligarchy as the government type.  Things were progressing about as I expected through the early and mid game.  The mid game does drag a bit, but I had a nice fleet built and had a successful campaign with my allies against a hated neighbor.  All in all, pretty normal.
Then, The Unbidden arrived.
It started with my scientists discovering an extremely powerful energy signature from deep space.  Nobody could pinpoint its origin or purpose, but that become clear all too soon.  The Unbidden, and extra-dimensional, spectre-like race opens a rift in the midst of a neighboring empire I had been friendly with.  I wasn't too worried about it at first - my neighbors were strong - and this proved to be an almost irrevocably fatal mistake.  
What began as a single system in a few short years turned into nearly half of the neighboring empire being consumed by the Unbidden.  It was at this point I took the threat seriously, and began mobilizing my fleets.  They had just come off a victorious campaign against a neighbor, so I was confident that the veterans would be able to easily dispatch this threat.  The first engagement was rough - the entire enemy fleet was destroyed, but I took serious losses as well that would take years to recover from.  Still, this early victory proved to be key.  I quickly researched the enemy debris left behind and saw a treasure trove of ship technology.  Still, there wasn't enough to make the discoveries outright.  
Then to my horror, as I was navigating the systems consumed by the enemy and clearing them of installations, I discovered a second enemy fleet of equivalent size to the first.  I had no choice but to retreat, and it was at this point that I realized truly how dangerous this enemy was.  
The northern fringes of my empire began to erode as the enemy's march continued unabated and his borders began to encroach upon mine.  I moved the remnants of my feel around to shore up my frontier, but it was too late.  A colony and frontier outpost were lost.  The refugees from the destroyed colony limped back into friendly space on a badly damaged colony ship, and I resettled them on an inhabited planet safely deep inside my territory.  At this point, the game of cat and mouse began.
I began cranking out battleships as quickly as I could at all my major space ports.  I had a range advantage on the invaders with my fleet, and began exploiting that as much as possible.  I sent in my fleets, still diminished from the first engagements with the implacable foe, into enemy space, avoiding fleet engagements and only destroying enemy emplacements and bases.  The guerrilla campaign worked, and yielded the precious debris my scientists needed to complete the research of enemy technology.  Deep behind enemy lines, they meticulously scanned every last inch of debris until all knowledge of enemy systems was gleaned.  Now, I was equipped with the same reactors and shields as the enemy.  I immediately redesigned my ships to take advantage and began churning out new ships with new technology.  Unfortuantely, there was no time for a fleet refit.  The older ships would have to be good enough.  Coupled with highly-accurate long-range, powerful energy weapon technology I had discovered on my own, my fleets were now more resilient and extremely deadly at long range.
By this point, there was nearly nothing left of the neighboring empire.  The enemy had consumed 80% of their previous territory.  Worse, the enemy was not settling the new space - they were just laying everything to waste.  There would be no negotiating with this foe.  Fortunately for me this drew their attention away from me, and allowed me to complete my newly rebuilt fleet relatively free of harm.
Years later, my fleets were ready.  Again, rather than choosing to attack the enemy fleets head on, I made an end run around the periphery of their systems and struck directly at their heart - the inter-dimensional rift through which their seemingly countless fleets were pouring.  I encountered immediate resistance from an enemy fleet, but with the new technology at my disposal, they sustained heavy losses before they were able to close to within range of their weapons.  Mopping up the remnant was easily, and the entire engagement only cost me one battleship.  
Now, there was nothing standing between myself and the rift...or so I thought.  In the thick of the fighting, I hadn't noticed the TWO enemy fleets of equivalent size who had warped in and were coming straight for me at top speed.  I immediately conducted an emergency jump out of the system, and spent time repairing my fleets from the damaged they sustained.  Entering back into the system, I was pleased to discover the rift was once again undefended!  Clearly this enemy was not accustomed to fighting a navy as brave as mine and arrogantly left their rift open for destruction.
After all this work it was easily destroyed, and the enemy lifeline was cut off permanently.  Still, I couldn't stand toe-to-toe with two enemy fleets angrily bearing down on me, so I flee again, and continue the cat and mouse until I get the fleets chasing me to split and finish them off on at a time.  Now, as the song goes, it's all over but the crying.
I'm now beginning the extensive cleanup that it will take to rid all the systems of their installations, but this turns out to be a boon to my nation.  The enemy was controlling space with void generators, and even though they have no colonies, they still controlled a swath of space equivalent to my own.  By selecting which void generators to destroy, I can control the retreat of their borders and at my leisure I can snap up the systems formerly held by my neighbor as they become available.
To the victor go the spoils.
This was just one of what will be undoubtedly one hundreds campaigns I wage.  This game is great.  There are some things that need to be fixed.  First, there is no espionage.  That's a gap for sure.  Also, players need to exert more control over fleet battles.  Currently there is basically none - just attack and retreat.  Ground combat is similarly shallow.  Performance starts to chug a little bit here and there, especially during combat, even on my robust system.  Nothing that can't be fixed with some patching/expansions.

281990,76561198035742939,0,0,0,True,57.1,May 14,"I honestly expected better of paradox. The 4x space games have always been plagued by certain issues, which I believed if anyone could fix it would be paradox interactive. Although before I go into my problems with the game, let me tell you about the innovative and fantastic parts.
Ethics is the political spectrum of stellaris. It functions within four axis: Materialist vs Spiritualist, Militarist vs Pacifist, xenophile vs xenophobia and Individualist vs collectivist. These ethics are not fluff, they have serious game changing relations to both your research option and the ways in which you can manage you empire. For instance pacifist get more administrative techs than militarist, but militarists are penalized for forming alliances. 
The personality added to both your own and AI empires is better that any customization I've seen in any other space game. I cannot emphasize this enough.
Pops are a very interesting idea and have allot of potential. Each location on the planet is represented by a Pop which has an ethic, race, etc. Pops harvest from a space or run a building on said space. If the pops can start getting different ideas about politics called ethical drifting. Or even mutation. Pops that are different from the accepted can strike and rebel. If is a well implemented and clean system.
While I am not sold on the current empire management system, this structure provides allot of flexibility for future content.
AI sensibility. One of my common complaints about the AI in other 4x games is that diplomacy lacks motivation. In paradox games the AI does not always make the most sensible choices, but it does not seem arbitrary. If it wants an alliance there is a good reason for it. If it declares war on you it is because it thinks there is something to be gained. Additionally, unlike many 4x games war need not end in mutual destruction after centuries of conflict, which keep the game from breaking down into a total war game.
End game goals are presented to the player to keep the late game interesting. These goals can range from defeating that fallen empire to some crazy late game crisis. I appreciate them giving the mega unstoppable empire challenges in the late game.
Paradox has made great strides in their tutorials. As the tutorial is actually more helpful than just reading a game manual. It still is not the greatest tutorial in the genre, but it is a giant improvement over VIK2, CK2 and EU4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I will talk about the problems.
A problem which has always plagued the 4x space games is one of the colonial rush. The colonial rush is that the ultimate winner of any 4x game is the one who can build the most colonies the fastest. In fact generally colonial expansion significantly outpaces military expansion. At the start of the game colonization is difficult and expensive, but once you achieve a certain size colony ships are build on an assembly line and are not picky about where they land, since you can usually colonize planets as fast as you find them. Mind you this is still while having enough money to any development which needs done and maintaining a large fleet. And course no place feel unique or important. Colonizing and terriforming a planet should be a significant investment and a careful choice.
Everyone has the same tech. I give paradox credit for the technology system, it has potential. The selection of a few random techs keeps the choices fresh and avoids the problems of optimal openings in the game. The problem is the technologies feel very bland outside of a few special techs and in the grand scope a technological edge is insignificant compared to production (since everyone basically has the same tech level).
Depth via micromanaging. For some reason when developers want to add depth to the economy, they tend to focus on micromanaging aspects of production. The space empire does not need to personally decree that a farm should be built or upgrade each and every farm in their empire personally. Instead the leader of a empire sets development budgets for different types of infastructure, only personally ordering large scale production goals such as a new colony or a new fleet. The king needs to concern themselves with policy (trade, economic, privatization, research, internal stability, foreign, military). However the king does not concern themselves with the execution of these policies. Back to the original I want to implement a farm development edict and give it a budget. I do not want to actually build each farm.
The game have sectors to minimize the micromanagement. You leave a section of the empire in the hands of a governor who handles the day to day operation. Unfortunately these sector go too far the other way giving the player nearly no control over what happens in the sector other than setting a basic priority for production.
Warfare, or trying to hunt annoying tiny fleets. Space is open so by its nature, choke points are not as much of a thing (except for hyperspace lanes). This openness means that one can attack any system at anytime and playing whack-a-mole against enemy fleets in your territory is not really fun or interesting. Nor is it difficult to fight a war on the other side of the galaxy other than the time to get there and permissions to cross the open space. Some strategy comes from customizing ones ships. Assuming you are technologically sophisticated enough to have multiple feasible weapons systems. Honestly ever space game out there lets you customize your ships. It is not longer interesting or exciting, but instead it's that thing you need to remember to do every time you developed a new tech. Generally fights come down to having a larger fleet.
Exploration is more than just finding things. It leads to quest chains and interesting discoveries. This provides a something to do in the early stages of the empire when there is little management to do. However late in the game exploration feels like a bit of a chore. As by the end of the game moving keeping a science ship moving from location to location is a bit of a chore.

In conclusion, stellaris is designed to appears to be designed from those who play 4x games. And in many ways the game is a massive marketing success, being familiar enough to both grand strategy and 4x fans. Fans of both types will find familiar territory and an enjoyable game. However for me I got into grand strategy games because I find 4x management bland and mundane. As with paradox's DLC policy, I feel this game is a work in progress. As it is a hybrid I am unsure how the DLC come out. I hope it will fix my concerns. I will watch its DLC and see if it addresses my concerns. While it is far from my favorit Grand Strategy title. I can certainly recommend it to others. If you ever were interested in Grand Strategy, you should own Stellaris as the first one.			"

The only negative thing i have to say about Stellaris are the little War-Options you are given.

281990,tylonfoxx,0,0,0,True,35.3,June 29,"I've been playing this for almost 2 days straight now, and this game still excites me... i'm currently on my 3rd playthrough.
1st playthrough: Start up as United Nations, end up in a resource-poor area. Neighbors hate my guts, but I get a decent empire going for me after destroying one of them. I got lvl II Warp drives and then ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a fallen ampire by colonizing a holy planet. 
Getting srewed over by a mighty 15K fleet (when building a 1K still takes long) pretty quickly taught me to beware Gaia planets :-)
2nd playthrough: Start up as Commonwealth of Man, invade United Nations early on, get defeated...
OK, so wormhole stations have to be protected well :-)
3rd playthrough (current): Playing as a custom race, and currently getting friendly with other races nearby, except one who got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with me early game. 
I aim to create a federation with the friendly races, and managed to get a good swath of space early on, including a nice cluster of 6 habitable worlds and loads of resources.
As for the game itself... Even though it's a pausable RTS, the game pace feels nice and comfy, even for me, who's used to turn-based games.
Research is IMO very well made. No huge, static tech tree, but random choices each time. The way research expeditions are handled, makes the game feel more alive IMO, and actually makes random encounters useful.
The leadership system is also pretty cool, and is also something that brings life into the game. Your leaders die off when they get too old, and you have to recruit new ones
Combat looks nice, but could use a bit more control. The most irritating of which is the inability to move out of range of a target, but still remain in the system. Instead your forces blindly attack anything nearby that's considrered hostile, and the only thing you can do is retreat out of the system (with damage and other penalties).
Diplomacy could use a few extra options... For example you have the ability to insult another empire, but you have no option to praise them (even when friendly) or directly bring them gifts (You can trade and ask nothing in return, but it's not considered a gift as such).
On the other hand, many of the politics (Vassalization, federeation formation, protectorate) are very intriguing.
The UI and default key layout handles well... The tutorial isn't too bad, but it could describe some of the important shortcuts (like ""M"" for switching between galaxy and system maps).
As for the game itself, The AI could be a bit more proactive in interacting with the player (so far, no AI has called me for deals). Happiness system isnt broken (like Endless Space), and works pretty well. 
The game feels polished, well balanced and like it has been made with lots of thought and consideration.
and of course MODDABILITY!
All in all, i'd give it 8.5 out of 10, mostly because of the small diplomacy and combat oversights

I wish managing leaders and your government was a bit more involved because right now there is a lack of interesting decisions to make in the mid game. In its current state (1.2) the amount of random events (similar to FTL) is too small, and I see the same ones around the same time in every new playthrough. Adding a ton of new events and political intrigue (like Crusader Kings 2) could really spice things up, and I'd be more than willing to pay for them as DLC because the management part of this game is fantastic.			"
281990,Septemberownsu,0,0,0,True,49.9,June 29,"Possibly one of the best games i have played this year (2016) or at least in the top 3. 
I would rate this a 9.5/10 and not by scales that other review sites use, more my own personal score which most games never breach the 8/10 area. 
First off. This game is a mix of two games, CK2/EU IV and Sins of a solar Empire. This isn't a RTS but also is. It is more of a kingdom management game with strategy elements. 
Some things you need to know about the game before playing or purchasing - 
- Research. There is a research function in this game which unlock modules/parts for ships, open up building options for planets and many other bonuses which help you advance through the galaxy. 
- Combat. Runs in a system close to EU and CK2, you have very little control and you rely on planning ahead to win fights. Like knowing what your enemy uses weapon wise or what their fleets consist of. You have 3 types of weapons to chose from and each have a special bonus to them, Lasers penetrate armor, Ballistics bust shields faster and have pen chance  and missiles NEVER miss where the other two can. Each of these 3 groups of weapons have subgroups with special abilities or rates of fire so there is a nice selection for ship building. You also have armies which you use in a siege system on enemy worlds. This is more to just occupy the enemy planets for warscore more than out right taking over a planet for your self. 
- Wargoal. This game uses a system for war which uses goals you set before you go to war. You can chose from a list of goals which up the amount of win% you need to win the battle. To explain, if i want to just show my might, i can go to war for nothing, and end this war when i want but still do damage to the said person by destroying their ships and buildings, but i gain nothing from this unless i am a war loving faction. Or i can chose to make them my vassal, which will cost me a rating of 70-90% win score to gain that goal or force it on the enemy. Warscore works by winning or losing battles and damage inflicted on the enemy faction, so just win your battles and it will go up! Simple!
- Ship Building. This can go from simple to complex. Don't be afraid of this feature, many are but it can work out even for lazy people! And it is very simple and explains how it works to you in the building menu. You have a set power limit on parts and you have to try manage that power with parts that give power depending on the ships size slots. If you want to be lazy you can just pick the guns you want and then hit AUTO-FILL and it will pick out what you need and what it also thinks you can add to help out. Then you just name your ship what you want! Fun! Easy! And once you feel comfortable with it you will be making alternate ships to pad your stats for battle and make something which looks like it would lose, win a battle without a sweat (Like running a 1000 power army into a 4000 and winning because you have special parts which regen your health or shoot missiles out of the sky/space). 
- Federation and allies. You make allies and can even form them into a federation which lets you become a massive blob monster which will rule the galaxy, much fun and also very crazy managing involved to keep everyone happy!! This was a feature also in EU and CK2 so if you are a vet of this, just remember how empire forming worked and you know what it is like but on a little bit simpler scale.
- Influence and expansion of empire. You can't take everything you see, which adds to the management side of things. You can't take every planet and inhabit them, which makes sense. You have to extend your influence on space and then build or just protect that space. Create sub-empires and oversee them while they pay you for letting them exist. This is something you WILL have to learn and look a lot into, it can be tricky but don't let that scare you from the game because it is so worth it once you get good at it. 
- Tutorial in-game. When and if you get the game, and you see no tutorial don't fret. The game comes with an inbuilt one which will activate and ask you if you want it on every match you start. So for new comers do turn it on and listen to some of what the AI has to say, some things will help you from screwing up hard early on, and of course this game does work off trial and error really in a way of management. YOU WILL FAIL MANY TIMES UNLESS YOU AREN'T NEW TO THIS TYPE OF GAME! So just sit back and enjoy your defeats, and learn off them.
-Faction/race creator. Chose from lots of weird alien types from bird creatures to slugs, boy there is a lot of choice here. For the furries there are lots of animal types like foxes and cats. Then you can name your federation name and race name. Pick the traits you want(little limited personally but i can see how they can expand it). Pick the type of government you want, be a god among your people, or a democracy, there are so many other types i couldn't even remember of course but they all have their benefits and problems! Also a flag maker, which is limited but the selection isn't too small, more colors would be nice but modders can fix that.
-Oh did i forget mods. People love making mods for these games so if you can think of something, probably someone has done it already or if not you could suggest it and maybe others will also beg with you for that! That is why modders are the best people in gaming communities really, or most at least. 
- LAST: Re-playability out the butt. This game is and will be so re-playable for people, from modding to just the huge variety they already have to offer i couldn't see you playing less than 100 hours of this game unless you got distracted by another game you love which happens! But seriously you can pick this game up and easily play 1000+ hours and still not play the game in every way possible. 
I hardly recommend games. And you can see that by how many reviews i make compared to games owned on the left, but this game.. is just so fun. I have probably missed a ton of good things about this game but i only covered those which people just need confirmed. It REALLY is a good game and i swear by it, but if you are still on the fence after all i said go to youtube and watch some gameplay or reviews by some more famous YT gamers. Certainly worth your time and maybe later money!!			"

Do you like other Paradox games where the goal is...well, whatever you want, since there is no win scenario? Then you'll likely like this (though you actually CAN win this one).  If you don't? Well...
You build a galactic empire, starting from a single planet. You encounter other races, you can ""uplift"" some, or infiltrate some technologically inferior ones to take over, etc. There are so many options, so many ways to grow, that there are many different decisions you can make.
However, the game can bog down once you get fairly in and have completely mapped your area. At that point, you might have to start conquering whatever you can around you to keep expanding. That can get difficult and boring, but it's Paradox, so if you like EU or CK, you're probably used to that by now.  (And, in my experience, this is worse the bigger the map.  Try with the smaller maps first!)			"

The lack of Mid-Late game and the small workshop pushed me away for a few months. But then they release 1.1 Clarke and 1.2 Azimov and there were more workshop items!
1.1 Was mostly a bug fix but added some new mid game features.

281990,76561197978295984,0,0,0,True,60.8,June 30,"At 54 hours in, I feel like I can properly review this.
I don't generally buy full-price games as I tend to sale-shop and find classics that I have missed, but I purchased this at full price primarily due to the commitment and work done on Cities: Skylines and the work allowed by *a publisher* (Paradox Interactive) to do the right thing.  I do distinguish between developers/publishers yet feel that I will give games a bit more runway when Paradox is involved.
I will say that thus far, they are performing exactly as I anticipated.  The praise for Stellaris is justified and the praise of the development team being committed is as well.  Paradox continues to allow resources to flow much more steadily toward continued development of a released game instead of simply abandoning the current product for a cash grab on ""Stellaris II"" or being completely focused on paid DLC.
With each update the game feels like the team has not only taken feedback but reviewed logs and gameplay stats to tweak the playthrough.  As of the Asimov patch, the mid-game has become more interesting, dynamic and engaging.  I would hazard a guess that we will see some more ""events"" occur to shake up the game with some bit of randomness as things move forward.
I will admit, I was tempted to go the new Master of Orion route initially just because I continue to have fond memories of MOO II.  That IP truly defined a genre and the work on the new release is tempting.  But this came down to recognizing that modern gaming is not just about getting it right at release.  It is about sticking around to make the game better even after you've taken your customer's money.  And in the end, that is where I chose Stellaris/Paradox.
Game is interesting enough AS IS and playable enough to keep me monkeying with things through several playthroughs.  Updates and potential for additional content just ""appearing"" like in Cities: Skylines (who turned out the lights?  When did it start snowing in here?) due to this being published through Paradox Interactive means I will give it some additional runway.
Right now, it is plenty intuitive (although the sector management took me a bit), enjoyable and interesting.  I haven't even started down the road toward some of the other races and philosophies yet.  I also haven't really made to the ""end game"" yet due to earlier missteps/restarts.  However, now with the latest patch I'm engaged more and the combination of game improvements and me simply learning the strategies better is leading this to be a much more enjoyable experience.
But don't get too cocky dev team.  I still feel like you could drop in some larger universe-effecting events.  Things that might require a large alliance or research treaties to overcome sooner than your opposition to gain an advantage.  And/or some broader effects of leaders dying or ships being lost to make it more ""personal"" via certain events (e.g. spouse of Captain Smith from Destroyer Devereoux lost at the battle of Apox has gained a following).  
And don't think I won't pay for some DLC somewhere along the way, but really, just keep going.			"

Edit:
I have played a bit more and although I have found some room for improvement I still really enjoy this game. The issue I have is that there needs to be some more tools to automate some processes. 
I need an interface to access the empires entire spaceports and let AI build my fleet according to my specifications (%'s of this ship and that, max fleet upkeep, etc)

I wish I could have a colonizing advisor that I could instruct with what race to seed each planet with, what traits to try towards, and options like only controlled systems, a minimum amount of influence, and ways to adjust the prioritizing of planets, like adjust how different factors are weighted (nearness to capital, useable tiles, tolerance of that type of planet, min tolerance to attempt).

That said, I'm also a big fan of space games in general and I wanted to like this title, expected to like it. The real time with pause, the bigger scale, the story-driven elements -- Stellaris isn't a classic ""4X"" game. It follows more in the footsteps of Distant Worlds (which I had trouble sticking with due to its cumbersome combat mechanics) than classic 4X franchises that I've worked on like Civ and Master of Orion.
I played Stellaris for a whole day and was having good fun with it. My wife complained that I should come up for air, because I spent all my free time on it on the day it came out. But I couldn't figure out why my empire was limited to just 5 planets in a galaxy of 600 stars. I complained about how slow it was on a forum and someone else explained how you grow your empire beyond 5 planets.
Sectors. What a dreadful design choice.
They filled the game with stuff to micromanage, scaled up their galaxy to huge proportions, then want to ""protect the player"" from having to micromanage on a huge scale. Their answer? Automation. You only get to control a tiny handful of planets directly. You have to automate the rest. Once you automate some you can settle new ones.
Did these folks somehow miss the memo on how Master of Orion 3 tried this move over a decade ago? And just how badly it went for them?
Anything not worthy of the player's time and attention should be abstracted away, not rendered in excruciating complexity and then automated by force. Strategy games are about making interesting choices. Having to automate most of your empire isn't an interesting choice. Far better to have a simpler design and a smaller scale to the galaxy, so that every choice matters enough to deserve the player's attention. They apparently cared more about realism -- depicting every planet in the Sol system, having lots of dead stars with uninhabitable planets -- and having huge numbers of stars and factions in massive galaxies, than they did about core gameplay.
There are things to like in this game, and I'm sure you can find lists of them in other reviews. For me, this notion of  forcibly automated complexity is a deal breaker. I wish I had waited instead of prebuying. The professional side of me does not regret taking a look at the game and seeing how it works, what I think it does well and what I think it does poorly, but the personal side of me is sincerely disappointed in what I found.
People play games to PLAY the game, not bang their heads against the desk watching automation play most of the game.
That's my two bits. Don't make up your mind based on my review only, though. Look around, see what others are saying. Maybe automating most of your planets isn't nails-on-chalkboard to you like it is for me, and you'll have more fun with it.
EDIT: Additional information. The Sectors seem to have a dual design. As an empire grows and factions develop within it, the game is supposed to have migration mechanics that lead factions to congregate in specific sectors. This adds internal political pressures to a large empire, which is a valid path to balancing big vs small empires. A Sector can be a home or base for a given ideological faction or even a minority race once aliens are part of a large empire. This part of Sector design may or may not be good -- I don't know yet -- but it's a valid reason for Sectors to exist, apart from the overzealous vision of how to shoo players away from ""too much micro"".
The part about only being able to control a very limited number of planets -- the ones not assigned to any Sector -- is a separate design decision. That is, setting up the Sectors as meaningful political boundaries is one thing, and forcing all the Sectors to be run by the AI is a separate design decision.
It would probably be an easy fix to open up Sector control to player choice and let the player decide how much micromanagement they want to do, instead of the devs imposing their will with the implication that they know better. ""Devs don't *always* know better."" Fans understand this.
Let the player control what they want to and automate what they want to. Just a suggestion.			"

The overrall diplomacy system makes up the bulk of this, making the game feel much more personal as the AI insults you,  compliments you, and tries to push their agenda on you. Each empire feels like it has it's own personality. The best part of this is that if an empire that has liked you for a long time ends up disliking you, they don't immediatley turn to a bland, blind hatred. They still acknowledge your former relationship and let you know that they feel you have strayed from the light. The only thing that I felt was lacking was more advanced Vassal interaction.
The ship customization is great, it's not overly complex, but just complex enough to make every ship between empires unique. The research tree leaves something to be desired. Until you've played the game through a few times you might find yourself a bit confused about what techs you're exactly heading for, though that might just be me and my lack of attentiveness towards research. The single player is excellent, but the multiplayer is where things really shine.
I highly recommend this game, especially if you have a group of friends that play it.			"
281990,beanchilla,2,3,0,True,60.3,May 10,"This game is definitely missing a few features I think would help flesh it out. If we had a more fluid trade system and espionage it'd be perfect.
For the time being though, it's the best AAA 4x game to come around in a long, long time. I can't think of anything that comes close. I am a huge Distant Worlds and Gal Civ 2 fan. This game manages to mix the 2 very well. I like being able to control the population on my individual planets while still spending a fair amount of time shooting ships off to explore, mine and research random anomalies in the world.
This might not be ground breaking gameplay but the writing, graphics, music and randomisation make it a blast. I'm only about 7 hours in so I haven't seen late game yet but I've enjoyed everything from my initial planet development to my battles with space squids so far. It's a weird game, with a lot of mysterious junk to find. It's a game where the other major civilizations don't even make their appearance until about 5 hours in. 
Distant Worlds wasn't so great when it was released either. Universe was a solid package because it had a handful of expansions fleshing it out. This game is already pure gold compared to Gal Civ 3 and it'll have no problem eating up your free time.			"

281990,76561198019149178,2,3,0,True,111.6,May 13,"Okay, so a lot of reviews out there are complaining a ton about a ton of things, and my question is, did I buy a different game then these people? This is as close to heaven for me as you can get, with paradox providing me with their style of grand strategy in space. The game play is immersive, the little details in how the game play works is amazing, and the game itself is a solid foundation for another great paradox game.
I've played every paradox game in the grand strategy genre, they are all very fun, but something that struck me about Stellaris is that I was able to pick up the game on day one, and start having fun. I hated EU4 on launch because I was comparing it to EU3, and now I love EU4. Hearts of Iron 3 was waaaay too confusing for me so i would go back to Hearts of Iron 2 or Arsenal of Democracy, and then I sat down and evaluted Hearts of Iron 3 on it's own merits and got immersed in it.
People need to stop comparing Stellaris to Crusader Kings 2, EU4, or any other Paradox games, because those games all have had time to mature and become the terrific games they are. For those of us who have dealt with Paradox's games on launch, Stellaris is far better then we have come to expect, and it shows that Paradox is growing as a company, the quality control is there finally, and they are listening to their fans.
Stellaris is a great game, the exploration part of it is something that is really exciting to me because of all the possibilities, the depth of interactions and options your empire and government has with it's own people, primitive races, and various populations is incredible. The fact that I have hundreds of things I could talk about in this review from the extremely large tech tree, to the various elements of the game  from how faster then light travel happens (Which actually allows you to defend your borders, unlike 99% of other 4x space games)  to the fact that you have hundreds of options to choose from and events that happen mean this game is something far better then what I haave come to expect from any other 4x game.
I love distant worlds for example, but I like Stellaris more, because the game itself is deeper on launch, it works better, and it's just plain more fun. Same thing with space empires, or star ruler 2 , almost every 4x grand strategy space game out there, I have tried it, and this one is just plain better. I don't know why people are complaining about the A.I, other then that they are trying to turtle in their games. The A.I fights wars against each other pretty often, and i've had war declared on me a couple times. 
I will agree the UI needs some work, and as we all know the DLCs will add a lot more content, but right now, stellaris is the best 4x space game I have ever played.
I would also like to point out how good the combat is, ships can be speciliazed and their tactics vary depending on how they are built and the controler they have in them, which creates a really distinctive feel for your fleets if you build them in a specific manner, and due to the rock paper scissors mechanic of weapons, there is no ""best ship design"", or even best fleet composition.
To be honest, I'm actually excited to pay for some DLC, i've got 60 hours out of Stellaris already, and I can't wait for more.

For real, though, this is the best space 4x I've ever played. The military route is fully fleshed out, dynamic, and interesting. Your ethea, traits, and neighbors actually matter. Everything matters.
Can't wait to see what they'll do with diplomacy and economy routes in the future. Right now they feel a little underdeveloped, but compared to the 4x games I came from, they're still way better. Alliances aren't made of paper, but they're not permanent and unbreakable either. All the resources are important. You cultivate your empire and help it grow. You don't feel like a mechanic tweaking everything in this game. You feel like a parent, a ruler, or a gardener. The game feels alive.
Highly recommended.			"
281990,ibalei,2,3,0,True,35.4,May 13,"The early game of stellaris is amazing, there is tension and discovery and even fear about what you will find that is palpable.  But after surging out ahead of my nearest neighbors, everything got really drawn out. The interesting quests that show up in the early game peter out quickly, and there is little to drive the game forward except your own interest in your empires story. 
Usually in paradox games like CK2 this is mitigated by the strong internal politics system that sees factions and leaders rise and fall and occasionally even the greatest empires brought down by a combination of internal strife and external aggression. 
This does not happen in stellaris. No faction ever gained any traction despite my empire eventually stretching out to over 200 colonized worlds, 19 sectors and me never doing anything to attempt to curb faction growth (hell I wanted it to happen so something interesting would occur).
Similarly, I couldnt have cared less who was my leader. They provided marginal benefits and I had little incentive to favor one leader over another, and stopped paying attention to who was leading my republic altogether, something I would never take for granted in another paradox game. 
Unlike other paradox games, you also dont really need a reason to go to war. I had a couple allies and we just mopped up our half of the galaxy cause we could, and no one else cared. Even in the end game, little political fallout resulted when four empires began conquering the rest of the galaxy. Eventually, the galaxy polarized into two federations, whose species were all on good terms with one another, but one was significantly stronger (mine) and whenever a federation president was elected we went to war to get something for the current federation president. Even after almost two decades of constant war, I was still at +200 relations with those empires we were attacking. This makes no sense. 
Then the unbidden showed up and we kicked their butts back to the void in under a year. (It took longer to get there than it did to defeat them). If thats an example of end game content, Im not super enthusiastic. 
Maybe never getting the opportunity to research a dangerous tech means i missed out on an experience in stellaris, but I have to say im somewhat disappointed in the delivery. 
TL;DR
Pros: 
Good Space Strategy
Excellent early game
Excellent framework
Cons: 
Very few interesting things happens in the mid game. 
Internal politics system is a non-issue
Leaders dont matter
Warmongering isnt a big deal to other nations.
End game is boring and drawn out
I will still recommend this game, because it is good and I see potential in it, but for now it falls into the category of space games where they take the big empty nothing of the void much too literally.			"
281990,76561198055387443,2,3,0,True,43.3,May 13,"I've played about 30 hours of Stellaris and so far I'm impressed.
The game let's you create a new species with different traits and governement types. When there are random encounters in the game you sometimes have options specifically for this or that trait. This makes the game even more enjoyable because with every trait you have the game can turn completely different from the last time you played it. Furthermore there's the research. Researching in Stellaris is different than most other 4X games, the things you can research all mostly random. For example if you started one game with early game good research it can happen that late game you will get some tech that really adds no progress to your game. What is also fun is the ship design and all the weapons you have. You can design your ships to be long-range or short-range, fully armored or fully shielded and there are far more things to explore with the ship design. What is also fun with the ship design, is that how smart you design your ship, how well your ship will do in battle. You can counter your opponents weapons or defense in the ship design. And then there is the different FTL systems you can have, each one with it's own pros and cons. This is only a small example of all the things you can do in Stellaris. But this all doesn't mean that Stellaris is a perfect game. It still has it's flaws, which is understandable because the game just came out. For instance my own race thinks that my leader is an alien. There are still some minor buggs and some things that are a little bit irritating, but most of them will should probably go away with the next few updates.
And then there's the multiplayer. Untill this day I personally haven't played any multiplayer with this game yet, but I sure am going to. The multiplayer seems a lot of fun and certainly a bit chaotic. If you would play with, let's say, about 20 players the experience will be much, much different than you'll have in singleplayer. There's all the alliances that can be shaped, federations that can be builded and wars that can be fought. I'm really looking forward to participate in one of these giant space wars. And ofcourse the other players are different than the AI. So you'll be having a lot of different, for example, trading offers than you'll have with the AI.
All in all the game is really fun to play and if you like these types of games I really recommend this game for you.

Key features I like:
+War Goals - You are required to determine goals for your war, not all wars about total domination or destruction and you can use that to your advantage when sueing for peace!
+The chance for your robotic population to become sentient and possibly create a robot apocalypse!
+The ethics system which immidiately provides tension and interesting scenarios with alien neighbours - it doesn't matter if you are the nicest race ever, some people just want to cleanse the cosmos of life! (Note: It also provides excellent options to work with races who have similar beliefs, providing the opportunity for easy allies!)
Anything else I can think of that I like is less unique to the genre, but let me be clear; this game just feels different than many other 4X space games, and I'm all the happier for it.

281990,76561198025643657,2,3,0,True,71.0,May 14,"After playing 11 hours now, to me this is closest to Sins of a Solar Empire except with a lowered initial stress/panic level that too many things are happening at once in realtime.  This combines the realtime aspect, the more real 3d effect missing from others like Galactic Civ and Distant Words, but it has far more gradual 4x feel to it and I think hits a really quite perfect mix. 
So I would say it's 
40% Sins, (realtime 3D, very little automation)
20% Distant Worlds, (It does have a live feel to it, that the universe is alive, and it's HUGE, and freedom to go wherever, not on a path)
20% standard 4X, (alot of exploration, alot of setting up cities, planets, mining, juggleing stuff)
20% Galactiv Civ genre. (Only in in the basic premise really, and the managing of planets) 
Overall I'd rate it so far as 85%
However, there are things that bug me a bit.
I don't like the separation of the solar system view and then jump to galaxy. When in a solar systems, I'd like to have a better visual sense of the galaxy around me as opposed to feeling like I'm in a closed room. A smoother transition between the two, or a seamless transition would make this game feel much much more immersive.
Doesn't seem like anything can be automated as far as scouting ships, fighting things, etc. This is good and bad, and so far has been good, but I can see where it might get out of hand as it gets much larger (and it will)
Hard to tell what to research next, as far as I can tell there's no ""This leads to..."" type explanation of new tech. 
When jumping into a solar system, the amount of icons can be overwhelming to quickly see what is happening.
There's no ""easy"" mode, just normal, hard and insane. I was quickly surround in a normal game by systems and races I simply could not overcome so my game just sort of ended because I couldn't expland or jump or explore new systems.

While I enjoy strategy games (a long time Civ player), Paradox games have always been on another level.  Usually when you read user reviews for games like Europa Universalis, you'll often see a comment about the learning curve.
What I enjoy about Stellaris is that, while there still is a learning curve, Stellaris is more inviting that other Paradox games, while still maintaining it's depth.
As far as commenting on the other aspect of the game, I'll be, in fairness, general due to the amount of time that I have played/the game has been released.  This game borrows from a few different space strategy games that I have played, such as Galactic CIvilizations, and puts them together quite nicely.
Lastly, as a final comment: I usually distain the ship design portion of space strategy games.  They have always been bulky and sort of difficult to manage sometimes.  Stellaris does it right.  You can customize your modules as you wish, or if you do not have any interest in this, there is a button that will simply press the best modules available so you don't have to worry about it.  But, if you do want to worry about it, you can, to your heart's content.			"

What's really good about the game:
- Nice details
- 'random' tech-tree
- nice events, research
- Great multiplayer  > playing from Belgium with my brother in Finland (4G)  No lagging, no portforward, just Steam join AWSOME!!
- fast patching > great support
- customable ships (I like to optimze my ship details)
What I miss/less good
- Lag in space-combats 
- A lot of possibilities, but no that much dept. Could have been more complex.
- currently playing my first game, but it's not really difficult (on normal).
Should you buy this game? 
If you like grand startegy (HOI3, EU4, ..) and space, this is a game for you.

My first ruler, Octavian I ony lasted one term then promptly keeled over and died, however President Wolf even through cycles where he lost support, continuallly got elected just after 1 term of a different president. 
Eventually I got tired to spending any influence, and Wolf became reelected 9 more times. When I saw that he was the ripe old age of 93 I told myself this dude has to go, he's going to keel over and die any minute so I supported a new candidate the next election. Note, in my republic scientists and governors alike had to my knowlege never made it into their 90's even with the longevity perk.
Lo and behold, old age isn't going to keep this guy from the presidency so after 1 term from the new president I thought he had already died. I made a critical mistake of not monitoring the election, and the next time I looked old Karl Wolf was back at it again at the age of 97. At this point I was amazed, so I just let him rule with no interference and he made it through 2 more elections before he finally clocked out at an insane 108 years of age.
I highly recommend this game, people will talk about the games mechanics (Honestly, they're great) and all that in other reviews but I actually wanted to share the story of my eternal president. He oversaw the republic rise from a tiny 1 planet system to the juggernaught that had almost 200 pops, through war and peace, and didn't stop overseeing it until he died in office.

281990,hudgenator,2,3,0,True,122.8,May 17,"Before you read this review, here's a bit of a caveat:
I'll begin by writing about one of my latest experiences, which is the one that stuck out to me the most. Not only did it exemplify everything that I enjoyed about this game, but it also drew everything I found wrong with it out into the light as well. I'll annotate it in a quote. If you don't care for that sort of thing, you can skip down to the actual review.
Originally posted by author: I started this game as humans under the Human Republic in a large-sized, spiral galaxy with 20-something civilizations in it. It started off as any other game in Stellaris would: exploration, colonization, and early diplomacy with neighboring civilizations. I was in the northern part of the galaxy somewhere in the middle of one of the arms. I ran into someone on the east, and I quickly established my borders. I then looked to the west for exploration and expansion, and I noticed something: no other AI upstarts were there.
Seizing upon this opportunity to build a rather large empire, I established outposts on every possible point of entry into this arm of the galaxy west of my borders. I sent out a science ship to confirm my revelation. He was nearing the end of the arm. Then I get a rather grumpy transmission that said something along the lines of, ""If another one of your pathetic ships crosses our borders, you'll never see it again.""
My science ship went MIA, and I now saw one of the stagnant ascendancies lying at the very end of the arm. For those who don't know, these are fallen empires that existed millions of years before your civilization's discovery of FTL travel. They are hardened civilizations that rarely take action in the galaxy until you p*** them off over one of their pet peeves. Anyway, they looked like a variant of humans with differing traits, oddly enough, but this was still quite possibly the worst outcome for my expansion.
Fast forward several in-game decades (or actual decades; I can't tell anymore). I now have one of the largest empires outside of a civilization composing entirely of hostile, religious crusaders. My republic now encompassed several different species (each one with one or two planet biomes to inhabit), and it was subsequently renamed the Republic of Sol. One problem remained: that hostile stagnant ascendancy. By this point, border friction had earned their contempt quite a few times. Every ten years, at the end of a truce, they would launch a campaign to burn our capital to the ground, p*** on the open flames, and then return home just as fast. It was humiliating. Literally, there was a diplomatic negative trait called ""humiliated"" that made me lose influence points.
The time was coming up on another one their conquests, but this time I was determined to be ready. In addition to some stations capable of pulling his forces out of FTL to a particular point, I built two large fleets that, while they couldn't take on his entire force, could easily take on the fleets sent to my capital world. It started. The initial invasion was stopped without a hitch. It wasn't a unilateral success, but it was a victory nonetheless. Wave after wave of reinforcements came, each one left me saying, ""How much more does this f***** have?"" The invasion was halted with just enough of my forces to launch a counter assault. I invaded his home world, which was filled with artificial constructs not unlike something you would see in a Halo game, with enough left over to keep his industrial centers at bay while I launch ground invasions. He capitulated. The war was won, and I now ruled over one of the most powerful regions of the galaxy.
The assimilation process was a long and arduous one. Constant rebellions called for an armed occupation when I no longer had the political capital to suppress rising separatist factions. Eventually, through multiple happiness influencing buildings and policy changes, they became productive members of my republic.
My empire was now entirely established. Even the tomb worlds, which are irradiated wastelands, were now occupied by an uplifted species the republic's citizens took to calling ""Snakeoids."" Alliances and federations were being created, and rivalries and political grandstanding became the majority of the game. The stories and events of the early game were gone, and I found most of my time was spent waiting for something to happen. I actually got up and did some dishes at one point, and nothing eventful happened.
Then I get another transmission that would change the course of this game. A team of scientists contacted me with a message saying, ""Sir, there is a large energy spike unlike anything we've ever seen. The location of this anomaly is unknown."" Commence the The Unbidden's extra-dimensional invasion of our galaxy.
Rivalries ended. Everyone that wasn't in an alliance or federation was at someone's door begging to get in one. The only exceptions to these being the fallen empires. This was a galactic, existential threat. Admittedly, I let it grow considering it was right next to one of my biggest rivals. However, soon I quickly realized enough was enough. I had to deal with this. It was enveloping nation after nation, and I had the largest actionable naval presence in the galaxy.
That's when one of my greatest frustrations with this game occurred. I looked to different nations to allow my military access to move through to deal with The Unbidden. I'm sure what the devs wanted to make seem like a moment of unity was anything but that. Not a single nation outside of my federation would allow my military passage to combat this threat, despite nations crumbling like dominoes under the pressure of extra-dimensional invaders pouring out of a portal. I was even limited by my federation, which limited a great deal of my diplomacy because I wasn't the sitting president. The Unbidden soon enveloped so much of the galaxy that even I couldn't effectively contain it.
That's the conclusion of that experience. I got so frustrated with a playthrough that I found to be so promising that I quit. 
On to the actual review. I will say that, as someone who enjoys a mixture of sci-fi and strategy games, this was a very satisfying scratch on a long-standing itch. So many promises were made on that front within the last couple of years, but most ultimately fell short. That's disappointing, considering I like the idea of liberating myself from game elements involving a historical context and running wild with something that hasn't happened yet. This one made it - for me, at least.
Stellaris does a lot of things right. In the early portions of the game, and even some of the late, the game is crafting stories for your emerging empire. These stories change. From playthrough to playthrough, even if you're playing the same species, the context and history of your civilization will never be the same. The government, policies, and diplomacy will change with the dynamic climate this game can offer. That can be a very beautiful thing.
However, where this game falls, it falls hard - very hard. The mid-game slows to a drudging crawl. I would find myself involving my empire in other civilizations' affairs, such as separatist movements, just to try to keep the dynamic feeling alive.
Overall, I recommend this game to a very specific type of player. If you don't mind reading a wall of text from time to time, which would explain why you're reading this, and you have a passion for sci-fi and strategy, it is a great game. The devs have some work to do, but supporting them with a purchase isn't such a bad thing. The game is definitely worth playing, but from the drudging mid-game to frustrating AI and diplomacy, this game can be better - a lot better.			"

Stellaris really did that for me.  I write this review at about 60 hours and I'm not bored yet.  I have really enjoyed the game play so far, the variety of playstyles and races, etc.
There are some points in the game that I would fix, but so far I think Paradox has been very responsive with their attempt to fix any bugs, and I have high hopes about them fixing some of the gameplay issues that I have run into (federation issues, diplomacy, etc.) considering how much I have seen them responding around Reddit and their forums.

281990,unitedfederationofplanets,2,3,0,True,63.9,May 14,"I had never imagined that Stellaris would be such a great game. Having played other Paradox games such as Europa Universalis 4, Crusader Kings 2 and Victoria 2, I had expected a very intricated and complex game in terms of strategy, but Stellaris has accomplished much more than this. Firstly, Paradox managed to get the genre perfectly. Being a Star Trek fan, I can say that there are inumerous features that are very resembling to the world of the original series. The game, however, does not restrict itself to Star Trek and there are references to various other classical features of the genre. Regarding the other Paradox games, I feel that in Stellaris war is not so important and it in peace that you wil play most hours of the game (specially at the first decades). Of course, being a mix of grand strategy and 4X, Stellaris was expected to have  some exploration  mechanics, but Stellaris also have loads of ways to develop your empire at peace. Moreover, the complexity of the mechanics are fantastic. They are in no way difficult to learn and it is very fun to manage the social and political aspects of your empire. The empire creator is also amazing with a lot of different governments to choose in addition to ethics and general characteristics of your people. The AI empires react to your presence mainly according to their and your ideology which makes for very funny games. Finally, the UI is a thousand times more accessible than in past Paradox games and the tutorial does a good job, which in my view makes the game not so difficult to learn to newcomers to the grand strategy genre.

In short, it's a mixture between a typical Paradox game like Europa Universalis IV and a Civilization game -- it's probably what Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been.
In my first game, I was able to make a fanatical spiritualist and somewhat collectivist society with a divine mandate, which I termed the Papal State, and which was led by Pope Francis III. I colonized several planets, killed some space pirates, and found out we're not alone in the universe. It's a very interesting game, and though I'm generally not a fan of science fiction, I would recommend it.			"

I have enjoyed my playtime so far for the most part, not plagued with performance issues, though a few bugs. The game as it stands is a flawed gem, lots of things are done right, but a lot of things are also not fully fleshed out. I appreciate that a lot of things are on the way to being fixed and added, but that's not a great basis on which to release your ""finished product"".
However, despite it's edges and sharp corners where ergonomics is desperately needed to streamline the interface and interactions with your empire, it's still a worthwhile buy. In time the purchase will become more and more worthwhile hopefully.
So I recommend it's purchase, but don't expect the game to be firing on all cylinders right now as some game mecahnics like trade and ""sectors"" need work.			"

281990,SiNNiS,2,3,0,True,225.9,May 15,"Surprisingly complex set of features and mechanics that feels polished  , satisfying and fulfilling on release. The framework is set for proceeding additions.
While I do have to admit that I have not played the late game as I keep restarting games to optimize my early and mid-game starts. I would like to share my thoughts on Stellaris so far.
It is easily apparent that Paradox have put a lot of work to create a framework that consists of different modules and mechanics, from a development perspective this should allow Paradox to easily add more to the game when it comes to complexity and tuning(not that there are any major issues at the moment).
A lot of people are complaining about mid-game being stale, I do not find this to be the case. Once the mid-game comes along I find myself trying to maximize naval capacity and have a fleet that is nearing that cap, being Militarist I put it to use. Wars are fast and furious, while it is not just about your naval fleet but also paying attention to your defensive and offensive armies. While I do admit that the AI is horrible some folks are already trying to optimize it via the LUA files and with some work from Paradox it is easily fixable more intelligence is added via IF-THEN statements.
In the current state the game plays fantastic, early game is fantastic and you will find yourself addicted to surveying systems to find high resource stations and decent planets and you will shout in glee once you find that 20+ Gaia planet. At normal speed there is plenty of tasks and micromanagement to keep your hands full at every second (day in the game) of every moment. Up the speed to Fast and you will have your hands full.
From a multiplayer aspect there are folks whining about corvette rushes, while this is an issue it is easily fixable by boosting the military power of stations and spaceports so that early corvette rushes get thwarted. I am sure there are others with even better solutions. Other than that MP is fantastic, I have been playing in the Stellaris MP steam group(shameless shoutout) and matches with 12+ players are running smoothly. Having this many players in a game along with 15AI to add some action to the early game gives the galaxy a feeling that it is very alive. The salt,politics and drama in voice chat are satisfying while everybody starts to fight over optimal planets/resources and federations begin to form.
While upkeep costs exist they do not hinder your science output if you keep your energy credits above 0, you can still sim city while being aggressive in the galaxy. Small things like research alternatives give an addictive randomness to the game and you will find yourself swearing at RNGJesus when you don't get that specific tech you needed.
This game is extremely satisfying and provides the excitement and adrenaline that so many other games in the sea of 4x/Grand Strategy do not provide. In the coming months and years I can see this game molding into one of the staples of the genre.
Issues that need to be fixed:
- MP balance issues (corvettes evasion is overpowered, worm hole is superior in relation to other initial FTL tech , Energy weapons generally outclass missles and kinetic weaponry)
- Spaceport , mining bases and early game defense is weak causing early rushes to be a problem
- Peace mechanics can be abused to stop players from joining a federation
- Number of planets does not scale well with science output (2% increase for every planet) , and there is no way to remediate this causing issues for Wide empires.			"

281990,statkin,2,3,0,True,35.8,May 15,"This is very easily the best 4X grand strategy game I've played. Having spent a lot of time with other Paradox games, mainly Victoria 2, this game does a lot of things really well. As with most Paradox games at release, this one has some problems but you can see that the game has tremendous potential.
First of all the diplomatic and trade functions in this game are actually extremely strategically valuable once you figure out how to use them to your advantage. Joining an alliance in the early game can easily push your empire into the fore front and trading for research and other materials is very helpful. The combat system and multiple travel technologies is very well done. The pop system and economics of the game are much simpler and easier to figure out and manage then other 4X games as well. The ability to design units is cool and well done. There are other interesting features like Fallen Empires, exploration events as well as the unique characterstics of each species that add to the replayability of the game. Some have said the AI is too passive, which might be true, but I can see that being an easy tweak or mod. The one thing about the AI that I love is that allies and vassals will actively help you in wars by giving your main fleet backup. I have yet to try out the federation system but that seems interesting as well.
Here are some things that are missing that, when added, will make this game nearly perfect. They are mostly quality of life:
1. Production rally points. Standard in most 4x games, kind of confused why they aren't already in it.
2. Autoexplore. Again, a standard feature in 4x games.
3. Ability to influence factions/rebellions in other empires. (maybe this is a feature I haven't yet gotten access to?)
4. Ability to see the full potential tech tree progression. Maybe its part of the upredictability of the game, but it's a little difficult to plan out your empire when you don't know how the tech tree is going to progress beyond the immediate research options.
5. Overall UI tweaks. The UI isn't as terrible as people are saying (these people clearly never played other Paradox games) but it does need work in some areas.
Other than that this game is definitely worth the $40. I haven't even touched the MP but I hear good things about that as well.

281990,abatrocity,2,3,0,True,86.8,May 18,"So, I've played about 40 hours of space Grand Strategy/4X hybrid Stelaris. In the game I've...
1) played as pacifistic communist space mold.
2) Played as a race of bird people who ""made allies"" literally, by genetically engineering them into existence. They also would find other non space faring civilizations and uplifted them into their enormous, multiracial, terraforming, psychically gifted utopia. 
3) That same civilization was later eaten by extra-dimensional demons who appeared from a rip in the space/time continuum. 
4) I'm now playing as a race of (I am not making this up) flying monkeys. Who have to collect all of the sub light speed probes they've sent into the universe in a more innocent age now that they could be collected by, I don't know, a militaristic fundamentalist race of ficus or something and used against us.
The game isn't perfect-it kind of lacks objectives other than ""rule the universe"" or ""don't get eaten by space demons"" and so for long spots in the mid game I was kind of making my own fun (hence all my showing up as bird-y travelers from beyond the stars to various iron age aliens) and there's some inconveniences with the UI and some micromanagement. But this is both much more accessible than any Paradox strategy game I've played before and more ambitious than any other 4X game I've played in ages. With the right post release development (which the studio is famous for) this has potential to be one of the greats. HIGHLY recommended.			"

So they evolved because of that into ""Meta-Humans"".
But you see in my ""Empire"", sub-species or xenos are not allowed to vote or have citizen rights, so the meta humans got a bit upset by this. So in the start they did some minor riots, minor clashes with the rest of the ""normal human"" populace.
But one day they thought; this isnt going good, we need to play with our genetics more! Faster breeding and stronger humans!
So all of a sudden, they are twice as strong, and breeds twice as fast as a normal human.
My solution? I purged the planet for normal humans (you know, because reason and i wanted to be allmighty evil emperor)
The Meta-Humans are all happy and cheerfull, grows a extra happines trait:D
What did i get in the end? a planet that produces twice as strong soldiers, increased mineral production and breed like rabbits while enjoying it:D

The game feels huge too me and I know I still have a lot of things to experience that I have not experienced yet. I could list more positive than anyone would bother reading, but on a negative note I think diplomacy needs impovement and I also wouldnt mind a ledger like in Europa Universalis 4 that compares empires as well as gives you a numbered score. I definately think this will be similar to other paradox games in the fact that it will have a lot of dlc, which I know many people I know will be upset about, but to the people who do not like dlc please understand that this is not only a huge game, but also a game that involves space which I like many people think is infinite and beyond human understanding so I feel like if they wanted to they could go on forever adding in new features. It seems there will always be new technologies that could be thought of. Other than that overall the game is great and I would certainly reccomend it to anyone who has enoyed paradox games in the past and to people who enjoy deep and complicated strategy games. So overall get the game and know that I was a person who never got very excited for this game like I am for other paradox games like Hearts of Iron IV, but now that I have purchased and played it I definately dont regret getting this game!

It's one of the best 4x games since Master of Orion II. Who is familiar with Paradox games will have no problems to understand the game. To new Paradox games players (Europa Universalis IV, Crusader Kings II), I recommend to watch one of the let's play Stellaris videos on you tube, to see, how experienced players play the game and to play the tutorial on a small galaxy with only 1 enemy race.
The game is similiar to other 4x games, but in real time, that can be paused at any time to give orders. The graphics and music are very good. The game has a lot of possibilites, like all Paradox games, without beeing too complicated. The start Races, that can be played, are good, but its too possible, to make a custom race.

281990,iriuru,2,3,0,True,61.8,June 7,"First of all this game is great. And it is something to expect of considering Paradox made it. However, It has a lot of minuses too but considering it came out recently (and knowing paradox they will probably release tons of dlcs and hugely rework this game judging by people responses) I won't judge it too harsh.
To be honest I was actually expecting this kind of ""timeline"" game from paradox it was just a matter of time. However I did not expect something exceptional and too good comparing to eu4 or hoi. Usually when companies decide to make something completely different, the end result is kind of lacking. And that is what I would say about this game, it is a good game but lacking in content.
To make it easier I can compare most of the aspects of this game to other games(which should be really hard for a good game). 
Let's start with diplomacy. First thing that came to mind was: ""Is this it?"". It's kind of similar to civ games where you don't get many options, you have to work a lot to make someone happy with you, and you can ruin a few hours of work with just 1 click. The reason I started with diplomacy is because I think it is the most important part of these kinds of games. For example in eu4 you have ton of options. You can declare war for one goal but take even more after the war. You can befriend other nations if you have same rivals and etc. etc. This game is lacking in this aspect. And I hope paradix will consider reworking it.
The second most important part is military or just battles in the game. Once again it is just lacking in complexity and options. It's similar to crusader kngs where you just dump all your army in 1 place and just martch forward destroying everything and anything. The only real options in customizing your army you get is the ability to change your ships equipment. And that is basically it. The numbers of ships and battle sizes are also kind of small'ish. You don't get that feeling of having a massive undestructable force of which everyone is afraid.
Empire expansion/exploring part. At first it was great. All those different and unique events, great rewards and interesting descriptions... However with time it gets kind of boring. It feels like everything you do is same and monotonious. It feels like this game would loose 60% of its gameplay content just by adding a ""automatically explore"" button. After your empire gets kind of large'ish the exploration part becomes more of a chore. 
Ciy expanding is another thing that I was disappointed with. When you colonize a planet all you get is predefined number of tiles where you build stuff and put your ppl in to get those resourses. It as a really similar to civiliztion and I am not a fan of such expansion system. 
It may feel like I am only bashing this game. But I actualy enjoyed it. It is a great game. It lacks in content and complexity but it is certainly enjoyable. Overall I would say it is more oriented to casual players. If you like civ games you will probably like Stellaris too.
I would recommend this game to new players. As for ""advanced/veteran"" paradox players, let's just hope it gets updated and receives enough attention from paradox.
