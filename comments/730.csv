Counterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it. 
Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO: 
1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'
2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 
3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'
Within a month -
Within a week - 
1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because ""Oh, It's only 30p"" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back. 
 2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 
3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.
The community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. 
But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.

You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own.
Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. FuÂ­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.
You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.
Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.
You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a pretty great game.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
First things first, the basic rules.
In CS:GO, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes:
-Arms Race
-Deathmatch
-Demolition
-Casual
-Competitive
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Summary of gamemodes: 
In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a ""warm-up"" or ""practice"" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. 
But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example:
2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade
3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades
Get the pattern? Yeah. 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. 
Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds.
The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. 
When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them.
Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb.
For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode.
So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Finally, competitive.
The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences:
- Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual.
- Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free.
- It's a 5v5.
- Competitive has 30 rounds.
- Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts.
- Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie.
- People are much more serious.
- ♥♥♥♥ blyat
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
So, here is my thoughts.
CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better.
GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. 
It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master.
I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet. Ping matters. 
I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. 
The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to ♥♥♥♥. Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping.
There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular.
The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, ""no game is perfect"", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender.
Not permanent bans, though.
The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
So that's my review. Hoped you like it!
EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO
About the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, ""omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick"". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed?
In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the ""left shoulder advantage"". 
| http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective: 
| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too.
As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.
Final conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play!
BTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved.
Thanks valve!

After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. 
The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. 
With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. 
I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.			"

730,teflon1,"3,259","3,762",60,True,19.7,"June 6, 2014","In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. 
When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. 
The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.
Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.
In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. 
Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.			"

730,NotOnMyWatch,"2,365","2,727",41,True,"2,889.8","December 31, 2013","I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia.  
I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.
I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. 
My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.
I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.
Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.
My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.
Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.
The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.
_
Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.
Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.
Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.
I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.
I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.
The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.
My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.
I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.
I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.
Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.
A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.
Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.
_
Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat.
Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""
Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.
From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.
The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.
Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.
Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.
Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.
Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.
I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.
I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia.			"

The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking sh it, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games. 
Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along.

The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency,  most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket.
Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache
The 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub.
Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation Maps
The 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 1500 hours - 9 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win'

I've been always AWP'd when going mid 
I knifed so many chickens
I played in servers with awful ticks
I saw women outside of the kitchen 
Oh wait, its just a pervert dude with girl pics
I got fps lows at the worst time
Lag when I wanted none
Many brazilians who were edgy to the line
All my pride is gone
And no matter how many rounds I beat
How cool I am in the middle of the heat
How many matches I win
I will never be Global Elite

730,3kliksphilip,"4,367","5,231",27,True,"2,385.5","November 25, 2013","CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.
In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.
The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.
Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.
There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.			"

Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect.  I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now,  Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore..

5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 
Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"
730,bananagaming,408,471,66,True,"3,924.1",February 22,"Counter-Strike is one of the most popular franchises of our gaming culture and is probably the most famous team-based multiplayer shooter of all-time. The first version came out 1999 which means it's been out for quite some time and it's still growing t'ill this day. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest addition to the game series and also the most successful one so far. I believe that there are three reasons for it's main success. The first reason is primarily because it greats new players well to an environment already filled with veterans. A great example is the games matchmaking system for competitive players which places you with others that are the same skill level. The second reason is how well they managed to implement new weapons and features to the game without destroying it's original charm. It's still the same game from 1999 but with slightly more diversity and variation which enhances the gameplay even more. The third reason is the ability to customize your items appearance, thanks to a community driven workshop and marketplace. The game gets regularly updates which usually feature new items and maps made partly by the developers, but more importantly by the community. You will have lots of fun and tense moments both casually and competitively and I highly recommend playing this game.			"

It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this.
I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was ""only a kid.""
Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles.

This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.
The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.
The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo.
 
There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.
Pros.
◘ Match Making.
◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.
◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.
◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.
◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game.
◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter.
◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!
◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.
Cons.
◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.
◘ Game could use some optimization here and there.
◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.
◘ RiP Desert Eagle, as we once knew it.

Ingredients:
4tbsp plain flour (about 100g)
1 large free range egg
½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water)
Pinch of salt
Butter for frying
How to make pancakes:
Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.
Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.
In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.
Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.
Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!
Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.
Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.
Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.
Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).
Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!			"

Ingredients:

2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 
Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

730,deathdisturbance,"1,645","2,137",0,True,763.0,"November 25, 2013","Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CS’s weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although it’s added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, it’s not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of £40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at £12, which I think is $15 in the US.
Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and you’re still alive you simply gain $0.
The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game. 
http://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpg
Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova you’ve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, it’s for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level.
Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way “ground breaking” it’s been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace.
I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS… this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you don’t understand what’s so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6u26YTpIF0
Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldn’t play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when it’s on sale at 75% of!
Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.
I would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review? Why was that, whats wrong with it? "

730,nnzh,"1,643","2,140",115,False,"1,445.9","January 14, 2015","I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.
Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.
Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?
CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.
If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.
Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)
EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.
Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.
At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches.

Makes one 2-layer cake
What You Need
Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (plus extra for greasing the pans)
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 large eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 cups whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/2 cups buttercream frosting, such as basic buttercream
Equipment
2 9-inch round pans
Stand mixer or hand mixer
Measuring cups and spoons
Cookie scoop or measuring cup, for dividing the batter
Instructions
Heat the oven to 350°F.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
Prepare the pans: Rub the bottoms and sides of the cake pans with a little butter, shortening, or baking spray. Make sure to get into the corners and all the way up the sides. Flour the sides and bottoms of the pan by scooping a bit of flour into the pan, then shaking and tapping to coat the bottom and sides of the pan with flour; dump out the excess. Alternatively, cut out a parchment round and use this to line the bottom.
Beat the butter and sugar until fluffy and light. Cream together for about 3 to 5 minutes on medium spread (see above notes for more information).
Add the eggs one at a time. Beat until the batter is very smooth and creamy-looking. Adding the eggs one at a time gives them a better chance at incorporating into a smooth batter. Be sure they are room temperature so the batter does not appear curdled.
Beat in half the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the sifted dry ingredients with the mixer running at low speed. Continue to mix until incorporated.
Beat in the milk and vanilla. Alternate adding in the liquids with the dry ingredients so the milk has a chance to be absorbed without needing to overmix the batter. Stream in the milk with the mixer on low until combined.
Beat in the remaining flour mixture until just combined and no more visible flour remains. Stir a few times with a spatula to make sure no more flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.
Divide the batter between cake pans. Use a scale or mechanical ice cream scoop to evenly divide the batter. Smooth the tops with an offset spatula. Drop the pans against the counter to shake out air bubbles.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes: When done, the cake should be puffed like a pillow, golden, and pull away from the sides of the pan. When done, a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes should come out clean.
Cool for 15 minutes in the pan. Run an offset spatula around the cake to make sure it's completely loosened from the sides of the pan.
Flip the rounds out of the pan, remove the parchment lining, and flip right-side up to cool completely.
Once cool, frost and assemble the cake with the buttercream.
oh, the game is fine.			"

Update something about racism.
Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay. 
I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players...
Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians.
Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell.

730,76561198006983702,386,496,39,False,"1,449.8","October 10, 2015","Pros: 
-It's a huge e-sport
-very well done maps
-it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve.
-It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick up
The game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed.
Cons:
-Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems.
-Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor. 
128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.
-The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game. 
-Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?
-There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)
-The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players. 
Conclusion:
The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around. 
If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.
I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.
The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly. 
All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.
But you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned.			"

There are three different weapons in this game, two of which are useless. The first is a gravity gun, stolen from the Half Life series (looks like these guys are going to get sued.) The second is a bag of pretzels, which restores health, but can damge enemies if thrown, and if the salt gets in their eyes. The third, and only useful weapon, is the PP-Bizon. This gun is overpowered in my opinion, and needs to get nerfed quickly, as it has 64 shots per clip, and more bullets means more damage.
I'm currently Challenger in the ranking system, which was far too easy to get, seeing as I previously played skilled shooters such as Putt Putt Saves the Zoo. However, this being said, if you choose to embark on your journey to Master Chief rank, be warned. You will face countless cheaters who will spawn infinite money so that the enemy team can buy all of the different hats available. In my opinion, Volvo should remove the hats, and replace them with weapon skins. But who am I kidding, who would be stupid enough to buy those?
If you're coming here from other shooters such as call of men, you're going to have a bad time. The closest game to this, in my opinion, would have to be Everquest. If you've ever played this, you should be alright coming into an environment such as this one, except with worse hit registering.
Overall, I'd rate Counter Salt: League Legend, an 8.1/10. No matter how bad this game actually is, people will still spend way too much money on stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ skins, and yell at their teamates for not checking connector.

 Deathmatch 
     If you are new you have to play this game. even people with 500+ hours might play this game. In deathmatch you are          able to learn how to use the weapons and how to improve your aim. That is why there is a possibility to turn of random weapons to you can choose only 1. PLEASE if you have 100- hours play deathmatch. (Dont use SCAR-20 to mutch.. people will hate you!)
 Demolition 
     In this game you have to kill people to get new weapons. Here you will learn how to plant a bomb. and how to use maps. you will learn you have to look back and look everywhere so you wont be killed. Also it is a good way to use multiple weapons. Not like deathmatch 1 weapon youre good with. 
 Arms Race 
     This game is hard. You need to kill as mutch people as you can. There are 16 levels. every level is a new weapon. kill 2 people to go level up. the first one who is at level 16 gets a knife. If he kills someone with the knife he wins. the maps are small and there are a lot of people. here you learn how to use every weapon (every weapon shoots different) (this will help you in Casual and more important  Competitive.)
 Casual 
     This looks like  Competitive. You have team mates and you have to win. sometimes its 5 vs 5 6 vs 6 8 vs 8 10 vs 10.  They maked Casual easier. Them damage is turned of. and you wont get a Cooldown. If you want to play this: in the beginning this will be hard. and you wont get mutch kills. if you play more it will get better. 
You choose 1 side and you will stay the whole game that side
  Competitive 
      This mode is for players with atleast 300+ hours ( I Thinks.. and a lot of players think that 2). Everybody plays this serious. Cause here you play for ranks. team damage is turned on. Its the same as casual. Kill enemy and plant the bomb. 15 round as Counter-Strike and 15 rounds As terrorist. the team who wins 16 rounds wins the game.
What I also like about this game is the face that everyday over 100000 people are playing. Every mode are people. you meet every day new people and sometimes new friends. 
every week you get 3 drops. ( most of the time 2 cases and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon worth 3 cents. sometimes a weapon with is worth more).  if you recieved the 3 drops you have to wait till monday then they will reset it. ( drops are random)
Also there are cases you can open. this is addicted like hell. In a case there are weapons skins. some are worth nothing others are worth 50+ euro.. if you are very lucky 100 euro/dollar or MORE! 
EVERY ONE WANTS A KNIFE skin.
weapon skins are useable in game. you can buy them are you can open cases. ( if you dont have mutch money buy the weapons.. not the cases ;) ).
last thing. Operations and championsships. 
ever couple months there will be an operation. that means. you have to pay 5 euro/dollar. and you get: 
5 New maps. Lots of Missions. New weapon skins. That is cool cause this will make sure the game will stay fun.
Also every couple months there are contest between the best players of csgo. you can watch them live! thats cool!

It's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update
 and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)
Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)
I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.
They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !
DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.
After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.
Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.
Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone 
 other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).
Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people 
 hence people having so many accounts.
I have 1 account and proud of it.
I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......
By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".
If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.
If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....
If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.
If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.
(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!
For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.
I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.
If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.
And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......
As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!
""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)
After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.
If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !
This game would be great........
 There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. 
But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.

730,LeZoidberg,"1,075","1,470",2,True,"3,283.6","November 25, 2013","At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses.
The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.
The game is simply tactful; itâ€™s brilliant when youâ€™re alive and even when youâ€™re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.
Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created
You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.
This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.			"

730,whisespoir,506,689,118,False,"1,593.3","September 16, 2015","Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:
Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.
Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience. 
Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...
BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.
Common idiots. Actually press f1.
I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.
Tryhards. Goes without any words :>
Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.
The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead. 
Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.
Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.
Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it. 
Thank you for your attention.

Pros
1. You can slowly get the money you paid for the game back with 1p drops in game
2. If your rich you can show all the peasants how cool your knives look and make all the Russian children trade in their grain stores to buy a sand dune nova.
3. Kill Terrorist ( big thumbs up from American players)
4. A deep and engrossing story line and ranking system with so much context into the terrorists motivations.
Cons
1.Terrorists are evil and no one tells me why, the game should be more politically correct or call them freedom, fighters.
2. Game is old and I cant kill ISIS, may change in the future if valve wants to make this game an immersive experience. 
3. Lots of children with horrible voices that make you want to use a cheese grater on your skull.
4. If you have friends you wont have them long as you will rage every time they let you die leading to you pouring piping hot tea on your sisters face. 
5. All developed nations decide to allow their troops to go to battle without body Armour making them spend their salary on equipment - 40000 immersion points.
6. If you are British there is a whole wealth of opportunities to hear constant slaughtering of your language and a barrage of Tea hate which will be most disturbing.

CSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanics
The Good:    (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight.
    (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in.
    (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage.
    (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind.
    (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that       are fun and interesting.
    (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game.
The Bad:Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO.
    (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.)
    (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.)
Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO.
Ack4orge Rating:10/10
Perfect
With the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market.			"

This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youâ€™re a Call of Duty player, youâ€™re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what itâ€™s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.			"

730,76561197988347964,877,"1,233",116,False,"3,941.9","January 31, 2015","The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.			"

 Story: 
Police versus Terrorists. You play on either of this sides.
Differenced in gameplay: You want to secure something from beeinng blown up or blew it up.
Alternative you have to secure hostages or stop the SWAT securering them.
 Gameplay: 
Easy to learn but hard to master. Forget about running with an Assault Rifle and give headshots to everyone like in other FPS. For this you have to choose the P-90. 
No seriously it took some time to know how to control the spray of your weapons.
Just pressing the fire button is not enough here. CS is still one of the most skill and game-sense required games.
To help you mastering this you can download and play training maps from the workshop.

After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. 
The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. 
With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. 
I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.			"

After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last!
First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive!
BUT:
There are some things Valve has to change really fast!
1. Cheating:
There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!
2. DDOS-ing:
I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!
3. Smurfing:
Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!
4. Patches:
Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!
5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):
Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!
6. Community:
The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.
Over all:
Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!
PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!			"

730,bashfulbritishboy,106,129,4,True,401.1,"October 16, 2014","Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.
Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.
With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.
I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.
The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.
I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.
And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.
But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.
All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.			"

730,proatbeinganoob,261,358,35,False,999.6,June 25,"I used to really like this game, but as time passed on so did my interest in it.
I lost the entertainment value this game had, it became very bland. There wasn't any playing the game for fun, as a guy with really no friends to play with, it was solo queue competitive for me. From there, I realized that the games community can be very toxic. and it became less enjoyable to play every day. I started playing less, instead opting to gamble the virtual skins, which techincally can be bought and sold for real money either through the community market or on a third party site. That was the the beginning of the end for me and this game, I started blowing tons of cash on the game, and if wasn't for a friend of mine who told me I really need to stop, I would probably still be doing it.
The two main reasons I cannot recommend this game is:
1. Toxicity:
This really ruined the feeling I had of wanting to actually play the game, for every one nice or chill person I met, there was 10 others who might act okay at first, but if you don't meet their expectations of skill for a match, they unleash their rage and discontent at you because you're risking their online status of how good they are at a video game, their rank. Community servers and third party matchmaking services didn't really help either. Third party matchmaking services were a bust for me, where you had the risk of enraging people even more for risking their rank and making their gametime less fun because of your lack of skill on something they've now paid extra for, for the quality promised from the service, or the risk of playing on a free service where no one really had to care, they could throw and troll and the consequences would be minimal, as it wasn't on official matchmaking.
2. Gambling:
I'm biased here, but this I feel this is a big problem which isn't addressed enough by the developers or the community enough. Everyone reading this probably has a good understanding of the negative effects of gambling, but it should still be said, it's addictive and it's not worth it no matter how much you think it is. Don't fall for the ""Free skins"" or ""Really good odds"" trap where they try to trick you into thinking you'll have an easy time of making money quickly.
Overall, I cannot recommend this game anymore, as all I can view from it anymore is toxicity and gambling addictions.			"

Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following:
 - It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's insults opinions. ""Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake.""
 - It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores.
 - It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. ""Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle.""
- It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong.
- It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while.
Of course, as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members, none of this will happen on its own--unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit.			"

It's just not what it's used to be anymore..
Community:
COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the ♥♥♥. 
Competetive:
I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.
Elo system:
Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! 
Skins:
A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. 
Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?
Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.			"

Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilise (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour.			"

730,mendozacheers,281,396,0,True,393.8,"August 24, 2013","The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.
I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.
Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.
Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.
Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.
Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first. "
730,AroNocebo,355,507,29,False,286.1,"January 17, 2015","Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any fun out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.
Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.
9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. 
Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't hormonal teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and or homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be hard if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire, I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature a lot. 
I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time, remember that. 
So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. 
If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.
By the way, to be genuinely good at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you must own at least one  expensive weapon skin, or better yet, a $300 virtual knife. They seem to be the major factor in judging ones skills these days(!).

730,IffyTohsaka,102,134,62,False,"1,180.1","April 11, 2015","An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?
Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.
Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.
The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.
The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.
The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.
Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.

Unless you find a server with a well-adjusted group of admin, be ready to be critiqued regularly, insulted for every kill, and harassed if you even think about just playing to have fun instead of to win. Don't use the weapon of someone else's choice? Then you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. If you're as lucky as I've been, and find comrades who just want to play without trash talk and accusations of cheating at the slightest hint of success, you can actually eke out some enjoyment from the game. Most public servers are pure-grade garbage though. Sadly, trying to complete one of the new missions they've implemented means sometimes having to tolerate listening to non-stop tantrums by some twelve year old whose voice hasn't even cracked yet.
And every time you decide you've had enough, Valve releases another patch with new gun skins because that's what draws people back in, and you realize that you can actually make money by just playing the game and selling the ♥♥♥♥ you receive for free just for playing.

PROS: [+]
-Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES)
-Frequent updates
-Tradable stuff
-Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics.
-VERY Competitive at higher levels
-Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps
-Weapon skins 
-Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more
-High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization)
CONS: [-]
-Skins can be expensive or worthless
-Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it
-Recoil is not very easy to get used to
-No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS)
-Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly
-Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN)
-MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION)
-Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels
-Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginners

Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots. Perfect for traders, casual FPS players, competitive FPS players, and workshop content creators.

The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp.  The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team.  This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages.
Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive.  The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2.  While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk.
Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol.  Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice!
Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for over $400 USD.
CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 300,000 players.  There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth.  I think its safe to say this is the new ""definitive multiplayer FPS""!

 Many of the things that distinguish GO from the other games in the CS series are its worst features. The player speed, acceleration and accuracy values, plus hardly any tagging (player slowing when shot) caused the adad technique where the player strafes one way then changes direction giving him a second of accuracy where he takes some shots. What this, plus horribly broken cilent-server hitbox sync translates to ingame is spamming the strafe keys and hoping to land a shot. All this gives us a CS that values frags over brains. As I said we thought back when the game was new that all this would be polished out, it was not.

730,76561198029856981,479,720,56,False,906.7,June 16,"  This review is for casual gamers and not competitive gamers.  
 As a gamer I recommend games that: are fun to play, help relax the mind, tell great stories, make the player philosophy, and aspire challenge. However, I cannot recommend a game when it creates an enviornment that compromoses these principles and fissures our moral codes. 
 The Worst of CSGO 
 CSGO has the worst player community on Steam / Reddit
- It's really no secret just how bad the CSGO community is; The players can be extremely racist, sexist, abusive, vulgar, and obnoxious. The toxicity can be seen in player profiles with racist/sexist/""meme"" usernames, avatars, groups, etc. 
- The Steam discussion section and Reddit page aren't any better; it's best to actually avoid any forums that talk about CSGO.
 CSGO is plagued with cheaters, griefers, and smurfs
- This is also a well known issue that has yet to be addressed by Valve. CSGO's competative is swamped with: cheaters who use scripts and cheat engines; griefers who throw games and harass other players; and smurfs who demoralize new players. 
- As of the date of this review (6/16/2016), the Prime Beta is on going. However, it isn't evident if Prime with solve the issue with cheaters and surely won't solve the issue with griefers and smurfs.
 CSGO's ranking system is broken
- If your in any silver rank, you know exactly what im talking about. Valve recently changed the ranking system in order to reduce the number of ""Global Elite"" ranked players in competative. Unfortunately, their actions also congested the starting competative ranks of silver, making it extremely difficult to rank out of silver, progress in skill, or enjoy competative with people of your same skill level. 
-compound this issue with the above problems, and you have CSGO matchmaking in a nutshell.
 Conclusion 
 CSGO is an extremely competative game that throws away common decency for the sake of what some can call ""fun"". If your a casual gamer or someone who is new to video games, avoid this game completely; This game will be completely frustrating and devoid of fun for casual players and drive away new players from the medium of video games. 
- For casual players and new players I would recommend: the Battlefield series, Arma series, DOOM, Chivalry, Team Fortress 2, Garry's Mod, Sniper Elite series, and / or Overwatch.  "

Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken.
They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUY
skins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free?  The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the ""season pass"".  You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. 
CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it.
Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking...

Also fair wanring; english is not my first language, spelling errors are expected.
 
Smurfs:
Enjoy sitting trough a 30-40 minutes of getting pwnd'ed. Theese guys just figured that its getting to tough and serious playing their own rank and want a relaxing game. the end result is that you will have a not so fun game where a smurf, or even a team of smurf is gonna basically show your head down the toilet. You can expect the same acompaniying trashtalk.
Hackers:
Well, more or less the same as the smurfs, but any element of fun is gone from the game. depending on what level of hacking its all the more infureating. Spinbotters are ok, they will at least make the game very quick. 
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s:
Theese come in many forms, but usually its the one teamate on your team who thinks he is kennyS and will not shut up so you can try to listen to footsteps, but totally knows without info that they are somewhere else and that you suck. also in this category ate the  two subjects mentioned above and dj's, trolls and the one russian souting GIVE ME AWP and stalks/blocks/shoots you untill he has the desired weapon, and then dies because he hasnt paid any attention.
Kids To Young to Legally Own the Game:
Theese are just cute to listen to, but share many of the traits of the A-hole subject. They will not shut up, altho they will try their hardest to actually play the game. Tho they have a tendency to scream off your eardrums, ragequit and start to ♥♥♥♥♥alk you, your teammates and the others, but its very entertaining concidering how old they are. Bring popcorn.
Other subjects, well, if you are superlucky you might get a fun challening game with people of equal skill. these games will test your reaction and teamwork. what can I say, theese games are just awesome and if you are playing with friends its sooo satesfying. All the different ways to take a bombsite or to get to a hostage, or defend it as the case may be will always be changing. Best to play with a full team of friends.
Csgo takes alot of practise, its not a pickupandshoot game. You WILL need to warmup, you will need to learn callouts and the maps and you definitely need to keep a positive attitude.
However as csgo is right now, 9/10 games will have a smurf or hacker theese days, and its made csgo horrible to play.To play any rank below LEM is horrible and will hell.
Owerall, dont buy the game unless you enjoy being frustrated; its to late for me but save yourself!!! :O
Edit 22/04-16
A helpful commenter reminded me of Russians. Now I do realize that not all the people we call russians are actual russians, but nowadays its more of a term of ""that"" kind of players... The ones that do not speak a word of english, and then rages as you for not listening to their helpful callouts... that you dont understand... or hear between their nonstop chatter.
At any point between the middle and end of the game, they might try to kick you for some reason.
Also, to anyone who says ""In order to beat the smurf you have to get better"" or ""its good training"" Yeah, ok sure, but its still not fun to loose constantly. Its not training, its demoralizing.			"

Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 
Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games.
Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland.
Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo.

It's almost impossible to spawn into the game without getting griefed by your fellow players, they will try their very best to kill both you and your chickens.

With all the tactics i learned from this game life has become easier for me. Whenever i'll go running im sure to take a knife with me so i can run even faster then i usually do! I made a fake bomb and painted an A on the floor in the living room. Whenever i come out of the shower i wrap my towel around my head and pretend to be a terrorist. I pick up the bomb i made and run around in my house. When i reach the living room i plant it on the ""A"" side and make some beeping sounds. Sometimes my dog gets close to me when i plant and he starts to lick my rectal opening. I think this is just one of the side effects of playing this game.

Competitive mode mostly consists of people that show zero respect towards other people.
They tend to flame, teamkill, etc. (you name it) others if players don't meet their expectations and will just ruin your game(s). Most of them lack communication skills as well.
Competitive mode is supposed to be a 5v5 team-oriented game but it just feels like a Onemanarmy:walkinglikeaheadlesschicken mode because most of the time people refuse to cooperate as a team.
For the other modes; I'm not going to cover them, either because they're not relevant for this review (This review is primarily focused on the competitive mode) or because the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mentioned above applies there too.
I only recommend playing competitive mode with friends. You won't get any fun out of it otherwise, unless you get lucky and get grouped with 0,01% of the community that are actually nice and show some respect.
A great game in the shadow of an absolutely horrible community.
Pathetic. Just pathetic.

Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed
Now to make it
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.
3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.
4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed
5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.
6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

But Counter-Strike is a FPS on a whole different level.
Its hard, Challenging and far from what most are probably used too but its so much fun.
A must have for everybody that loves FPS!
Dont let the price fool you. This game if far beyond awesome than most FPS which u pay around 60 euros for or more.
You play matches with people in your own skill rank and u rank up when you get better.
You dont have to worry to get in the game and be shooted by people that are 50 ranks higher than you.
the game runs smooth, looks really good and you can play deathmatch against bots and other people, or competitively & Alone.
Its highly addictive and for the price it is right now definitely worth trying. 
Incase you buy it (Which u should!) Have fun

You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him)
So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly.
But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle.
So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off. 
Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it.
Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox.
I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down.
Then I asked myself, ""Self, what do I do now?"".

730,-knife-,49,59,8,True,"2,507.0","April 12, 2015","So I've been playing this game for long enough that it deserves an honest review. After playing a lot of TF2, I bought CS:GO and it was a relatively smooth transition for me due to my TF2 experience. CS:GO easily became my favorite game to play. I originally got ranked at silver 4, and started my climb from there. Over the course of roughly a year, I've made plenty of friends, and learned a lot about the game. I'll separate this into two groups below:
The actual game:
CS:GO is a game that, for me, bridges the gap between a competitive game and a game I can play all day just to have fun. With CS:GO's matchmaking, it is quite easy to get into a 5v5 competitive game with people of equal skill as you. Matchmaking is a great way to start playing competitive CS:GO, but it is not ideal if you want to improve. If you want to take CS:GO more seriously, you have to use 3rd party services such as FaceIT, CEVO, or ESEA where you will face players that have a higher skill level than in matchmaking(not really FaceIT, FaceIT is the ""entry-level"" service, at least in North America, so it has a lot of newer players). Unfortunately, Valve's matchmaking system is flawed and has smurfs in low ranks and hackers in high ranks, so most people that want to improve or play seriously tend to use 3rd party services.
Also, CS:GO has community servers just like any other source game. These community servers run different mods and feature special community-made gamemodes such as KZ, bhop, minigames, retakes, awp only, scoutzknives, and many others. These various gamemeodes supply me with hours of casual fun with my friends when I just feel like relaxing.
Trading/skins:
Trading has effected CS:GO both positively and negatively. With the addition of weapon skins into the game, CS:GO grew rapidly. CS:GO trading brought a lot of TF2 traders over to CS:GO and started an ingame economy similar to TF2. Also, skin betting on csgolounge was added. Betting skins on professional matches lets you put skins on your favorite teams to cheer them on to victory. The thing is that many people take betting way too seriously(death threats to players, ddosing matches, etc etc). Csgolounge betting has had way more negative impacts on the game than positive in my opinion. I personally try to stay away from trading because it is honestly too stressful for me, and I have no patience.
That's all I have to say about CS:GO right now. I would recommend CS:GO to everybody that plays any type of shooter game. A mere $15 has given me nearly 2000 hours of enjoyment, and it will continue to supply more fun for me for a long time. "

You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them. 
  Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at ""master guardian elite"" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds.
  You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these  legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for ""suka krisa"" gameplay.
  Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill ♥♥♥♥, because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters.
  Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to ""distinguished master guardian"" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters!

730,LazyPurple,48,58,4,True,922.6,"November 28, 2013","This newest iteration of the series that single-handedly sparked global interest in competitive gaming leaves little to be desired. While its beginnings were bumpy, the developers have listened to the community and are still listening, regularly making the game more enjoyable and beginner/spectator-friendly while still maintaining the integrity of the competitiveness of the game. I have high hopes that Counter Strike will be seeing a comeback in popularity. 
If you enjoy competitive gameplay and bettering yourself against greater opponents, you should have no doubts when choosing to buy this game. It took me over 500 hours of gameplay to get to a skill level that I feel content with (I am currently the second-highest matchmaking rank). Thanks to Global Offensive's ranking system, even a lone player can have satisfying matches in the matchmaking system and grow in skill on their own. Yes, the occasional blips happen where you're put with unreliable teammates or put against unreal opponents, but these are only opportunities to better yourself and learn what you can do as a player to increase your odds.
When you do decide to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I encourage you to put your all into learning about the game and bettering yourself. Research what you can do to train your aim, what you can do to train your recoil control, and watch pro players to learn about game sense. For a game in which you often times find yourself waging the same battles at the same chokepoints, it is remarkable how every battle can be just as tense as the first one you ever participated in.

This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).

730,76561198172212134,107,154,9,False,"1,085.1",May 31,"As I am not a friend from quickly looking at a game then glorify or damn it, I decided to write a review after playing more than 1000 hours. 
If you like skilled games and train hard to become better, this game is one you stick along time with it. After hundreds of hours, you still find ways to play it, places to hide, tactics to use etc. So this game greatly combines skill with tactics and teamplay and from this  I would highly recommend it. I also like the point, that you can obtain skins for your favorite weapons but to pay more for coloured pixels than for a real gun or knife is pervy. 
BUT the longer I play this game there are things that really suck with this game. A bunch of friends starting with me to play this game do not any more cause of some very bad issues. 
With more hours and over 280 competitives won, one should think to have become a better player than with 100 or 200 hours of gameplay. But fact is since the change of ELO system, which since seem to adapt to a balance of the ranks I (and a lot of my friends) did not manage to get a better rank than GNM, thus beeing MG2 before. This means in my case I am still an average player, who did not gain any progression in game skill. This I would have to accept. 
BUT if I do competitive MM in a full team, where no one is smurfing we have the chance of 50/50 to play against enemies who do have one or more players, which are far better than the best player in my team. So often they confess to be smurfs (People playing with a second account on a level much lower, than their main accounts), or they might be hacking or they are high level players boosting up new accounts for selling them later. So this is the reason that average players have no change going to higher levels. Valve might have recognized this issue since they intend a premium membership of accounts which are confirmed by smartphone (so it would be expensive fÃ¼r smurfs or boosters to have a lot of different smartphone SIM cards). 
In Casual Gaming people advertize that they use hacks, advertize for hacking websites e.g. a i m w a r e . n e t,  e z f r a g s . c o . u k etc. I did report them and looked into their steam profiles weeks after that but they never get VAC banned after weeks. Steam and VAC does not seem to much effort in VAC banning these people and getting these websites removed. 
There is also one thing that could be improved: Steam should provide servers with a tickrate of 128 for competitive MM. Steam is earning a lot of money from people ""paying to shine"" for weapon skins or knifes, so money should not be the issue. 
I still will play this game for some time, but considering the game fun and nearly lack of progression for average players I do not recommend this games to start with it.			"

730,KushGaming,40,48,8,True,"1,605.8","February 9, 2015","It has been nearly 6 months since my review so I felt it was time to update my review with my current thoughts. 
CS:GO is a very good game for its simplicity. The game is your standard FPS, no I'm not saying itâ€™s the same as a free to play first person shooter but I'm talking about its base platform. It's a first person shooter that is strongly built around search and destroy. Though by entering the casual scene you can join servers for zombie, zombie escape and many other custom types of game modes.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not your average fps like call of duty, you will have a hard time if you think you can join the game and have accuracy when moving. (FFS P90). Once change you will need to make when switching to CS:GO is to stop when shooting. 
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has a skin system that if you are a gambler then I feel sorry for your wallet. Skins can be earned by playing matches and once the game ends you have a chance at skins (skins from cases will not drop at the end of games, these can only be received via market or cases) cases also drop sometimes after games. If you receive a case you can spend a few dollars to open to it, the case spins as it shows the guns and the line will eventually stop on a gun skin. That is the gun skin you will receive, if you are lucky you will get a knife that can be valued at a very high price depending on the knife. An alternative to cases and free drops is the market which can be access via steam, search Counter-Strike: Global Offensive section to via all gun skins. Gun skins are purely cosmetics and provide no advantages at all.
Counter Strike: Global Offensive has three play styles. Casual, Match Making, eSports. Players looking for fun with friends without dedication to 60-90 minute games or players who like fun modes likes zombie are considered casual players. Match Making is where are ""new"" player should start if Counter-Strike is a new game to the player. This allows the users to get a general feel of the game, get put into a skill group after 10 games and eventually learn the maps and calls. Match making is the place to start even if you plan to get into eSports eventually. Match making is considered the 64 tick servers which you will hear people cry about a lot but don't worry about it too much. Once you get the basics down you can make your way over to FaceIt, Cevo or ESEA for competitive 124 tick servers and if your good enough jumping into the eSports scene. I don't suggest ESEA for players without experience because ESEA is where a lot of pros and very skilled players go. Once you think you are ready for eSports then form a team with friends or make your way over to cevo forums, reddit ect to form a team and start practicing. This will take time and dedication to prefect but if you have what it takes you'll get there.
Letâ€™s get to the final review shall we? (My numbers are actually very high as posted, I never give 10/10 unless the game is near perfect)
Gameplay: 8/10
Graphics: 7/10
Customizable: 7/10
Community: 6/10
Pros:
- Can customize guns with skins.
- Offers enough gameplay for any type of fps gamer.
- In-Game voice chat
- Has a fairly large eSports scene
- 64 tick for lower end computers/internet users.
- 124 tick server for eSports and some casual servers.
- Large pro scene followers.
Cons:
- Toxic players (This isn't all the time but is often enough to say there are a bunch)
- Smurfs (Users who are at a higher skill level and buy a second account to play with lower levels) only reason this is a con is because it may be the reason for your deranking in MM (If that matters to you)
- Hackers (Now this isn't a game with a million hackers but the game goes on sale so often that hacker accounts are bought at cheap in mass bulks)			"

730,AnnuCheekiBreeki,77,109,10,False,363.5,"June 28, 2015","I have played this game since October of 2013 and nothing has been fixed, they continue to add broken weapons and being unable to properly balance weapons, the Tec9 is still OP, it took them months to fix the CZ, the M4A1-S is still the king of CT weapons due to its lowered spread, recoil, and higher damage at ranges. The hitboxes are still awful because of how animations are blended and not snapped into place, you need to be rank 3 to play Competitive even if you're a Global Elite or Legendary Eagle Master, meaning you have to play with Silvers for 6 hours if you want to play Competitive, it's especially bad considering you have to buy an Operation Bloodhound pass to get XP faster. They should've just kept it the same as it was in January of 2013 without the flash boosting, the C4 planting and jumping hitboxes were still messed up but it was generally just a better game. I refuse to play this game until they fix the hitboxes, which has no ""ETA"" currently but ""Valve has acknowledged it"" so basically they said ""screw you, we're not fixing the hitboxes, thanks for the money.""
What a joke of a game developed by a joke of a company, I can't believe that they have let the game get to this state, and Valve's support is a joke in general, enjoy waiting 2 weeks to get a reply.

You can say:"" Oh game looks pretty good and alot of my friends are playing in it i must to try too!"" But i must to warn you. If you are very sensetive person and testy like choleric[en.wikipedia.org] i really don't reccomend this game for you. In this moment yes this game become really worst game in the world. First of all rank system if you care about your rank -> you will care about lose or win( of cource you want to win) -> you will start to rage, insult, rude. Ask yourself please does this game cost your nerves? Does this rank cost your nerves? Just imagine libra in your mind and on one side put all bad things which happend in this game to you all bad days, games, etcetera and all good things which happend to you in this game and you will see the truth. But if you are actually not a raging person and really dont care about your rank or will you win or lose like me :) Grab your friends in there and play for FUN! There are alot of funny stuff...ehm..runboost, bhop, some tricks, lucky shots, knife/zeus trolling, etcetera... you can even just laugh with friends and play! Or if you alone just play on yourself try to make some good kills but remember no rage...
Anyway i can talk here really alot of time about smurfing, cheaters, guys who  calls everybody a cheater xD, etcetera.
But do we need this? I think we dont :P So actually i can't say that i recommend this game for someone this is a good game for someone the worst game ever so this is not me to decide this for you. Everybody already maked his/her choice.

I would definitely recommend this FPS game, however you need some friends because matchmaking alone is not ideal. The only thing i don't like about it is the 64 tick servers in matchmaking.

730,Systride,35,42,5,False,951.7,January 4,"A Sophisticated CS:GO Review.
Alright, it's time for a honest and sophisticated CS:GO review, no hate, just criticism.
I've played this game since the beta of around August 2012, and I'm here to tell you that it didn't really get any better.
It went all from a competitive team-shooter to a game that's more about the skins than about the actual content featured in the game. For example, we've had a few operations that actually added some new gameplay style, but then again, you need to pay for those. And most of the time the updates revolves around some case with some new community skins in it. (Valve to lazy to design own skins).
And then there's the community, now I know there's alot of actual good people out there, but the majority of them are,  you guessed it, Russians/Polskis.
Now i don't mind people from Russia or Poland aslong as they play normally, which is most of the time not the case. Most of the Russians / Polski I've met in game are just general derankers and or griefers. Personally I don't really give much about a matchmaking rank other than the bragging rights, but derankers and griefers just take the fun out of my game, and that's just not cool. The most important thing about a game is to have fun, right? Well sadly I cannot say I can recommend to play this game solo if you expect a fun match.
And then there's the new matchmaking system everybody keeps talking about. I've experienced it myself, I've lost a couple ranks myself, but from a personal point of view, I don't see much trouble in it. Ofcourse, it's not fun to lose 3 ranks if you win 9 and lose 1 and get deranked. But the real thing is, if you really have the skill I'd recommend playing other things than matchmaking. (like ESEA, FaceIt, LANs) I can understand that people get frustrated if they lose their hard earned ranks, and I agree with them that it's a pretty stupid update, but Valve won't revert the update anytime soon, so it's best to learn to play with it.
Overwatch and matchmaking bans are flawed. Overwatch doesn't work because most of the players can't see the difference between a good player, and an actual hacker. Sometimes someone makes sound, and the Suspect just has very good sound so he hears him. Lower ranking players aren't able to hear or see this and convict him of wallhacking. 
Matchmaking bans are bad because too much team damage and you get kicked. But for example, I throw a firebomb and my Russian team runs into it and stays in it on purpose, then I get banned. Also accidental grenades while rushing are also a part on this.
As this review comes to an end, I cannot recommend this game anymore.
It used to be alot better back when the gameplay actually matters, but right as of now, VALVE is only interested in filling their wallets. The result is a very broken game with broken mechanics, and not so community-approved updates. (R8 back in release.)

- Skins (you love them.)
- Stickers (some are pretty.)
- Competitive matches (they can make you ""1337"".)
- Life time support and updates confirmed (operations, tournamÃ«nts, and other future contents.)
- Reasonable price (minus low discount rates for those want another copy.)
- Cheapest Steam trading cards on Steam Market.
- Still a ""classic"" FPS game in terms of gameplay.
- Source Engine is not power hungry and thus the game is widely accessible for lots of players regardless of their computer setups; this is one of the important factors to be a popular game.
CONS:
- Skins (you can't have all because: rarity, monies, life issues, et cetera.)
- Stickers (some are ugly.)
- Competitive matches (they can ""rekt"" your mind.)
- It is somewhat hard to find and make a correct teabag position to desecrate fallen foes and allies due to ragdoll physics being client sided (you often see teabaggers teabagging side by dead bodies, not exactly on the bodies.) Teabaggagement must be well practiced with rich malintent and delicacy in order to execute and demonstrate a successful teabaggary to variety of audiences.
- You can't kill hostages anymore unlike in previous Counter-Strike games.
- You miss the Arctic Avengers and terrorists in the green jackets.
- Multi-GPU setups (SLI or CF) can potentially cause stuttering issues and even some FPS drop.
- AWP needed nerf? (3/31/2015 update.)
- StatTrak swap tool (3/31/2015 update.)
- Our money magically disappears from time to time.

-You need at least 1K hours to be decent at this game, and no, I'm not talking about Global Elites, there are hundreds of players times better than the highest rank in CS:GO and not all of them are pros.
-This game is so bad that Valve had to implement skins in order to lure new players, otherwise the playerbase would have been a lot lot smaller now.

But hey, there are still some cool things, imagine you not warming up at all and hopping into a competitive game, you start CT side on Nuke and first round, the T just kick your ♥♥♥ and that continues for a couple of rounds, still you don't give a ♥♥♥♥, you did not join to win, but then you start getting mad headshots and end the half 8:7 for your side. After this your team is like: ""OMG, they won so many rounds on T side, they gonna win"", but you have other plans, you lead a ramp rush and even though you a silver, you make it successful through a smoke and get even more mad headshots. In the end you win the ♥♥♥♥ing game.

(Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competetive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your freinds or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" againt players who purchased a secondary account and posess the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competetive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, becuse you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These higly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smufrs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practially forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)
-----Update 1------
Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. 
One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. 
As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) 
Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :D
Good luck and (try to) have fun!
----Update 2-----
Thanks for all the responses everyone!
The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :D
I actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.
One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.
For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. 
I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.
I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.
GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!			"

I cannot recommend it because this game destroys people. It's a good game but at a terrible cost.
No, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games.
But truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside.
Matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team.
When it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying.
If it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank.
You are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often).
If you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you.
Maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust. 
The better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater.
Where is the fun in all this, I ask? You can be proud of yourself when you win, or survive in an action where you were meant to die, but each and every accomplishment you'll get will make you crave for more, and at one point you won't feel much from winning, but you will feel a lot from losing.

Heads up to the community for making Counter Strike as one of the biggest e-sports titles again.
But if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. 
In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure. 
Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is.

Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.  "

today ill let you know that cs is a gud game with highly skilld people ( like me and my lads )
we like to play cs a lot but sometimes we get mad because the other team is better than us...
this is very rough and we call them cheaters to justify that people cant be better than us. 
I sometimes break my table but its ok, my mammy always gets me stuff so im good. 
I also break other things, but i still get new stuff.
Best way to play this game is if you take a walk then do some squads and then proceed to play a little bit of deathmatch where you can hear grim russians talking a little bit of blyat language.
This is also a very good start of the day to me. I love spamming with radio commands to the point where my team tries to kick me, sadly they cant. I always play with a lad who is always there to back me up, and he always votes no so i keep on spamming radio commands! 
Sometimes i dont play too good but its okay i just play the next day. 
i like to use the sniper Ayy double you Pee <3 becauase back in the good olde days i used to play mw2 where i was a professional amateur quickscoper. 
There is also guns like the ak but i dont like that because the bullets go up and thats not fun for me when i shoot.
i haf ben playing a little bit of cs for a while and im actually global max rank. 
Sometimes i get happy when i derank cuz then i can rank up again and you get very happy when you rank back up!
this game is very gud if you like to meet new people and exploit other cultures cs is the game for you.

✓ So i gave a thought for long time about what i'm going to write down on this review since it's one of my favourite games on steam.
GAMEPLAY RATING:
✓ So far i can tell that the gameplay really makes fun especially the gungame , deathmatch mode and the normal casual stuff. Developers definetly achieved to create a varied and half way balanced game elements in this fps game.
they still do some updates and make some changes by and then just to appear it more interesting.
✓ From the point of technical aspects they succed so far ( at least in my opinion ) , because all different weapons can be used for certain situation so there aren't many weapons which are superior to others, in addition you can balance this by teamwork and strategic actions. Yes this game is not only about skill, it's more relying on teamwork , which is also an interesting fact about this game, because high skill doesn't mean anything to this game.
COMPETETIVE OR NOT? :
✓ For me there are only two sides of this game : Competetive and non competetive
✓ For the non competetive part i can give a recommendation, because it bonds a lot of fun and variation for players.
✓ In contrast for the competetive part, unfortunatly  i can't give a recommendation. You sure ask why.
The reason is the community itself, it's poisoned with pathetic low self-esteem people who create smurf accounts in order to hack and ruin the game, and as if it's not enough they also insult for no reason . they probably do it to strenghten their self-esteem or maybe they need mental help i don't know , somehow or other it's really bad.
Almost every match i only read on the chat "" look on my main account im *insert here high rank*"" . so if this is the case why are they even owning a second account then? and making hacks appear so obvious?! i really don't know. And before people come to me and to label me as a low player, my highest rank so far was Supreme master First Class, but i don't care about such stuff, it just ruins my mood to encounter obvious frauds who also try to insult you via mic or chat just because they don't have got any balls in real life. that's why it is so pathetic. In addition some random players in your team also do some mistakes on purpose to ruin your day more. i mean i play this game to get rid of my stress and all i get in return is only more stress. i wouldn't even care if i would lose all the time, when i could be sure that they aren't hacking or insulting each other like 10 years old  kids. It's also a sad fact that people think big of them by hacking and can't even speak a single word in english, like if they are some uneducated people or anything.
✓ i will still play this game, probably because i still have faith in humanity, but so far i only got disappointed.
TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT:
✓ Recommendation for non competetive games : YES
✓ Recommendation for competetive matches: NO
✓ The decision is still up to you. "

WTF has happened? 
This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.
DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE
I have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.
Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.
Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.
There is huge but in all this:
Are you willing to pay a subscription?
If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.
This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time.			"

-The actual gameplay is flawless and it offers more than enough customization options to ensure your comfortability with the controls. There is also a huge abundance of guns, maps and unique game types to pick from. 
-I'm sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but I feel that the game's increased difficulty, relative to other first-person shooters, makes it much more rewarding. It is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it.
-I typically don't pay any attention to the chat/voice communication in multiplayer games such as this, but I quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review. I can tell you that just like in many other games, the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general. Ignore the rage and you'll be fine.
-CS:GO has a workshop with tons of community made maps that introduce unique game-modes and styles. It goes without saying that this adds hours, maybe even days, to the replayability and allows you as the player to better customize the way you play and enjoy the game.
 
Overall, it's an awesome game and I only wish I had picked it up sooner! If you can handle the somewhat toxic community and the high skill cap, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the perfect first-person shooter and I recommend it!			"

730,JaffaParty,35,45,6,True,"2,181.9","May 26, 2015","Lets ignore the aggressive silvers and *cough* Russians *cough* and focus on some positive aspects:
Gameplay 9/10
The gameplay itself is on par with perfection, with customization options such as crosshair (shape, size, color ect), left or right handed play and of course the beautiful console interface which makes everything just THAT more simple. Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot.
Graphics 8/10
The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.
Sound and voice acting 10/10
Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the ""Terrorists Win"" and ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming ""♥♥♥♥ BLYET"" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!
Game physics 8/10
Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)
Community 6/10
Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.
Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)
It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH! GLHF

Every skill jump from nuke has been removed. Perfomance has been getting worse and worse with every update, making the game to the point of unplayable on my below average computer, whereas in source i get a constant 180+.

730,76561198010863844,29,35,0,True,"1,302.3","January 21, 2014","It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later. 
CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back.
It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been. 
Pros:
 - Updated maps, visuals & sounds
 - Emphasis on team play
 - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers
 - Extensive customisability & player drops
 - More realistic player and game behaviour
 - CS:GO workshop
 - Pro players
 - Active development and regular updates
 - Listens to community
 - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolution
Cons:
 - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S
 - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater.
 - Sound still seems like an afterthought
 - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks good
Ratings:
Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvement
Sound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enough
Gameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability
Overall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.
Footnote:
I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved.
In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.			"

**The Good**
* High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS 
* Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends 
* Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions
* Devâ€™s connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation. 
**Needs Improvment**
* Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). 
* Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). 
* Movement and accuracy modifications.
* Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) 
* Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate

Counter strike GO offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training.

There's an authority and you are undermining it
The majority is decent but you're a crying ... If you just cheat cause you ""Wanna have fun too
And you don't have the time to go through the grind too""
Then you're just lazy with your selfish little world view
All the other people in this game have had to learn too
But you, well, you just get that little soft aim
To help you destroy everyone in every comp game
You go into leagues, you think you are so clever
And then cheat for money, now that's on a whole another level
You are not a little rebel, you are just really sad
You can't deal with the fact that you're prolly really bad
But that is not an excuse, it's just a disgrace
You are fake, and you're due for some vacation days, haha
Hey It's vacation day
You can blame your dog while we all play today
So hey sing it It's vacation day
I guess it's over now with all your blatant plays
Come on hey vacation day
I got this vac ban but my friend played today
Hey vacation day
See you never again never again!
Some people are just dumb, what could we do
But that some people are as dumb as you is kinda new
Cause we cheered for your teams and some cheered for you too
Now we feel like some fools cause we cheered for some tools
It's like you screwed all us over, the people that give views
The people that take time to support the things you do
And the plays we thought were cool, now make us feel uneasy
Just because some of you thought there's some easy gains in cheating
You were eating out of the hand, that you sawed off with a small saw
And now you're expecting us all to let you draw the long straw
But nah brah, it's over, you're decisions have been made
If i see one of you on stream again i ... zap away
You don't deserve to getting paid for the things that we all love
And corrupting them with hacks and then think that you're above
I just hope that good people in the scene won't break away

Now, let's be calm for the last part
Let's all start with a fresh start
What happened, has happened but it's just an exception
And we can't let them take us apart, so let's make it a lesson
It's just a fact that there are cheaters, but not everyones one
Some of these people have dedicated their life and their fun
And we can't start a witch hunt, cause they banned some fools
Just remember if you cheat we won't stand by you
Some people are just passionate, you gotta know that
Some people like fair play, nothing below that
So if you're pro, try at least to be decent
There's kids that watch esport and maybe you're the reason
So if you're cheating they may think that's ok
So you as a role model now have ... failed
And if you think that's ok, cause it's not your job to raise them
Then you're right, but maybe your mindset isn't amazing
You should try to be the good guy, try to be modest
Try to be honest if you ... up the smallest
Look at Pasha he's not flawless, but he's the ... man
If he ever gets a vac ban i'll eat my ... hat
As you can see i get mad, easily at someone cheating
I just don't understand what these people must be feeling
This god dark quick, i prolly should have played today
Well, at least i'm not any vacation, yay!
Hey It's vacation day

Even the final product released a year ago was good.
Since the introducing of the skins, performance went to the drain (bear in mind the Source engine is 10 years old now), stability is a word of a past and the COD effect among newcomers is at an all-time high. This is not even remotely satisfying.

So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.
Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open. 
So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game. Which is disturbing when you connect to the game and you hear a 9 year old talk about his up's and down's with gambling his skins away....
I would not recommend buying this game unless you intend on being a troll and can stand not getting agrravated by other trolls on this game.			"

I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE!

  Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for Â£2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full Â£12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.

730,OfficialSwaM,27,33,7,True,"3,252.9","April 30, 2015","Hey. I am going to make a review of the game Counter Strike Global Offensive
My experice - I have played cs for 2k hours + watched/followed the scene for a long time and now some history as well. I hope you learn something and maybe even buy csgo after you've read my review. :)
Counter Strike is an fps game, where the only thing that matters is skill (aim + gamesense + communication). It's the opposite of a ""Pay to win"" Game. It is true that u can spend how ever much money you want on Skins, but that will not make you as a player better in game. 
MM - The matchmaking in csgo is good. You will get matched up with close to equaly skilled player. It is 64 Tick servers something that alot of people complain about, but most other FPS Shooters have 16 or 32 Tick Servers (ex. COD). The biggest problem with MM IMO is Cheaters. As you rank up you will face more and more cheaters. Valve is working on (VAC), as it has been 4 ban waves (A cheat is being detected by VAC making everybody using the cheat VAC Banned) very close together. 
Skins - Skins don't add any value to your character (and there is no way to make your character better in any way) so it really doesn't matter if you buy them. It is going to stick out a big more which makes it easier for enemies to spot but that probably won't make that much of a difference in game. 
So know you think that everything is bad with skins. No. Skins help fund Major CS:GO Tournaments (250:000 dollar tournaments that are Supported by Valve). They are also very fun to play around with, trading and betting with. You can make huge profits and huge losses, but as I said. You don't have to buy them. 
The Pro Scene - The Pro Scene is very entertaining to watch and has IMO the best layout. There are 3 Majors Every year(Most likely going to be more as time progresses). There are also the Normal tournaments every once in a while (1-4 weeks apart usually). The pro scene is growing very fast an we will see a 1 Million Dollar leugue hosted by ESL and ESEA this year. 
MISC - There is more to cs than what meets the eye. All the strats, Smokes/flashes/molos etc. But there is also the surfing/bhoping (etc.) side to the game. There are servers where you can do lots of other game modes if you get bored playing the normal game (which you probably won't as it is very addicting).
Final Thoughts - CS is a great game for a low price which will run on your PC, it's very addicting and fun. There is also frequent sales in the steam store. I hope you Join The CS Community, gl and hf.

730,nerdhouse,46,66,2,True,76.8,"November 26, 2014","I'm probably going to get ripped by veterans due to my ""low"" playtime, but I felt like CS:GO deserved a proper review. Let's hop right into it, shall we?
Originally designed as a Half-Life mod more than a decade ago, Counter-Strike has endured because of its well-balanced, competitive gameplay that requires skill to succeed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a revamped version of the classic first-person shooter, offering some tweaked modes on the same maps that helped define the series. Those unfamiliar with Counter-Strike will find the game more a cerebral experience instead of the run Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn gun, arcade-style action popularized by recent iterations of Call of Duty.
In Global Offensive, there is no regenerating health, no cinematic storyline, no experience points to level up your soldier, and no unlockable kits or perks. The deterrent for dying is having to sit out and watch as the rest of the match unfolds. While this may sound disappointing to those weaned on more contemporary shooters, Global Offensive' comparatively pared-down experience is no less thrilling. The game's focus on teamwork and tactics gives the game a distinctive feel as you choose between four online game types as part of a terrorist or counter-terrorist faction.
Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are team-based modes played in multiple rounds. The goal in each is to either eliminate the opposition or be the first team to complete a map-related objective. Depending on the map and your faction, you'll either rescue or defend four hostages, or either plant or defuse bombs at two specific sites. While the goals in both Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are the same, the differences between the two are primarily in terms of scope. A Classic Competitive game consists of 30 rounds instead of 10, enables friendly fire, and has you earning money for kills, planting bombs, and so forth that's used to purchase armor and defuse kits. The casual variant gives you armor and defuse kits automatically.
The other two modes consist of Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race, which has been adopted by both Call of Duty: Black Ops and Battlefield 3's Close Quarters expansion, consists of a single round where everyone begins with the same weapon. Each kill automatically changes your weapon until you receive the golden knife. The first person that lands the killing blow with the knife wins the round. This is the only mode where respawns are possible, offering a nice change of pace from the standard modes. Demolition is a mash-up of Arms Race and Classic, taking the fixed weapon progression from Arms Race and including two multi-round matches that have you trying to plant or defuse a bomb in a bank, safe house, and other locales.
What makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive appealing is that it plays differently from its competition. Tired of jumping assassins in other games? Jumping here will penalize your accuracy. Sick of seeing more praying and spraying than in a baptism ceremony? Then you'll appreciate that those who use short, controlled bursts while aiming will be more successful. If there is one knock on the game, it's that it offers the same maps as earlier versions of the series, giving veterans a huge advantage over new players. To offset this, the developers included an option to play against bots offline so you can practice each mode and map. This will give you a fighting chance against ""real"" players, but expect to die early and often until you hone your skills and familiarize yourself with the map layouts.
Or course, the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is how much you want to play after a session ends. This is where Global Offensive excels, possessing the same addictive quality that helped make the previous games a long-term success story. Shooter fans looking to diversify their library or prove their mettle against a talented pool of players shouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger.
Highly Recommended

730,volka,24,28,0,True,"1,242.4","September 10, 2014","Basic Gameplay
You play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.
You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.
On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.
Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.
As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.
Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.
I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.
Positive attributes :
- Matchmaking 
- Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)
- Ranks  
- Cool looking skins
- Fast growing population of players  
- Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often
- Chickens
- High replay value
- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)
Negative attributes :
Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. 
I REALLY wish it were longer.. 
And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded.""
- The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno""
Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.
It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.
- Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)
Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!
The volka Strategy
You could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR 
you could play the game correctly like me. 
Here is my strategy :
-  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.
-  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.
- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.
- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].
- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.
- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.
In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.			"

Closet hackers
-No spread. *shots never spray out of a tight grouping*
-ESP. Getting perfect peaks around corners, body/headshots through doors, headshots through smoke nades, perfect accuracy while blinded. (Ability to see your body through walls as if they're playing with the spectate ""X-Ray"" feature during the game)
-Aimbot or Toggol Aimbot = Countering a rush killing off everybody rushing or Clutching an entire team.
-Anti-Aim = Bullets do not register as hits on the player.
Rage Mode Hackers
-Mad spinning (RPM's that rival your cpu fan), Straight up BHOP into spawn and wreck your whole team (or enemy team if matched with you), all the while spam name changing and spam advertising the website hosting the cheating program @ ""X"" Price for ""X"" months licensing.
I was Master Guardian 2 before this wave came in. Now I fell 2 ranks.
Yes, ragemode hackers do get banned.
No, alot of closet hackers play with esp & no-spread only and usually cannot be confirmed %100.

12/28 - Couple months ago I made it into overwatch beta.
During the downtime, when this game wasn't in the limelight (Oct) for a while, the case reviews against players actually cheating was about 1 in 7. Meaning , a full 60 minutes of watching 6 players who have been reported for playing well with no indication of cheating. Followed by 10 minutes of 1 player darting his reticle to enemy players through the walls throughout the game or the occasional asshat(s) body blocking an awping team mate, blocking a teammate into a corner, teamkilling/damaging a teammate to low health.
When the holiday auction hiccup happened and people got free cs:go copies, that ratio went from 1:7 to 1:1.
Every other case was like a throwaway account not even attempting to hide it, staring at the ground, spinning like crazy, bhopping throughout nuke, dust2, and mirage headshotting every player they came across.  ""Hey look at me Get ♥♥♥♥ on baddie $0 accounts bro."" As of late december It's 1 in 3.

- Matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games, enjoy your bot! 
- People get random Matchmaking bans, because they can`t reconnect due to bugs!
-You have to decide what player you are, you have 2 options. You can be the noob or the hacker. 
As Noob you basically have worse than 1,0 kd. As Hacker you are above 1,0kd, pretty simple, isnt it.

You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge. CS:GO is a game that will 100 % occupy you if you're eager and competative or even if you just love community based games with a sht ton of human interactions through VoIP			"

Gambling in Blackjack offers a better chance in winning the jackpot than the crate system. 
This is what CS:GO has become. Most people, not even gamers, only see the illusion that they can win some super rare knife instead of playing the game. It was the obnoxious ""Arms Deal"" update that struck down CS:GO into a trash game and the later updates only made it worse or did nothing to improve it. Don't believe me? Since micro-transactions were introduced, floods of scamming bots sent me friend invites in attempt to trick me and for weeks, I had to reject and block them. Yes, it stopped but the damage was done. Lots of idiots could not see past their greed and lost their items and complained so much to Steam support that they implemented those Steam Market policies that punished everyone who uses the market. 
For the other side that do care about the game to some degree, they're just as bad too. Just about any action you do just leads to an immediate reprimand from other players to the point, why bother even playing online? Then comes to the badly handled competitive system. When I did join, I keep on having idiots on my team or a player who would not stop mic-spamming and was kicked. I had to put up with this for around one hour and nearly all the time, the incompetence from my teammates cost me of a victory. Never again. 
And now, that ""Co-op mode"" has bordered CS:GO to a game like Call of Duty and Battlefield. The ""Operation Missions"" were one of the earliest examples of that. They have failed to regain my interest and trust in the game. 
Also, the community is toxic, more toxic that an irradiated area of Chernobyl. The community hub is filled with threads at the top page that complain about getting a VAC ban, trade scam, or competitive ban around 90%. The other 10% is usually a giveaway. The community is also hostile to any sort of criticism, calling out anyone who dares to criticize their ""holy"" game as ""silvers"", ""noobs"", etc and thus become narcissistic in what they think is their own right. Guess what? I played the game long before the ""Arms Deal"" update and the community was not like this. It was a decent game and it was much, much better without nearly everyone clobbering over a virtual item. As such, you guys most likely make Minh Lee and Jess Cliffe embarassed by forgoing the true spirit of Counter-Strike. Want to prove me wrong? Then don't leave those cliche'd insults in the comments page. 
CS:GO should be put out of its misery one day and I suppose until that day comes, I play the older Counter-Strike games that actually gives more respect to gamers (and the modding community, regarding weapon skins and models that had more work put into them). 
Can't comprehend with this review? Deal with it. I have lost faith in the Steam forums anyway due to the immature nature of people here.			"

Compared to the previous iteration, some weapons have been replaced with similar counterparts while the maps have been upgraded and balanced more appropriately. Admittedly, the game was riddled with issues during the early stages but it has matured drastically since its inception, owing to Valve's diligence and community feedback. CS:GO's 250,000 concurrent players and the ever expanding competitive scene stands testimony to this game's successful approach. At the heart of this game is the community's boundless imagination full of custom maps, skins, stickers, and soundtracks that add style to the gameplay.

I used to play this game quite a lot, and I am so glad I stopped. This game used to be fun, until skins happened. That's when all hell broke loose, the game rose in popularity, and everyone in the world started playing it. It was cheap and runs well on any system, so you don't really need anything special to hop in and start playing. This usually attracts idiots and kids. Since then they've been flooding the game and made it pure awful. Not just is the matchmaking system broken and the community is trash, there are countless cheaters and smurfs. Oh, you wanted to play one game without constant unbalance? Well, you're in the wrong place. The community is toxic, rude and overly narcissistic. Cheaters, while being as blatant as possible have the audacity to ♥♥♥♥ talk when it's very obvious what is going on. Wanting to kick you because you decide to save or make one single mistake. When you ask to get kicked for having to go or whatnot, nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥, and you're doomed with your ban. Make ONE small mistake like accidentically flicking your mouse and boom, kicked. The smurfers are stealing kills and ruining the game, everytime I play with one I'm just planting the bomb while he gets aces and if I'm lucky I get to kill one player per second round or so. When there's a hacker on my team and I insist to kick him, my teammates give two ♥♥♥♥♥ and won't kick him for the sake of winning. When he's on the other team, they trash talk us blabbering about how he's just a good smurf. My ♥♥♥. Also, VAC and overwatch ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. I see hackers everyday, and VAC takes it sweet ♥♥♥ time and lets them ruin the game for as many players as possible before they get banned, on which they create a new account to continue cheating. Oh, and the game costs absolutely nothing. Don't even let me begin with knives, ♥♥♥♥ing $300 for a knife? I do agree in the skins looking cool and all that but seriously, why not spend that money on upgrading your computer so you can admire your knives in better quality? And the case unboxing is ridiculous, I cannot count how many Negevs I have gotten from spending $50 on cases. On top of that, the matchmaking always puts me with 12 year olds. I'm sick of kids saying ""fokk yau bish"" in the worst accent possible. The workshop is also horrible, there's nothing but ugly AWPs, AKs and M4s. Most skins doesn't even have a purple variant, and I honestly don't see why there are 6 covert AWPs and 0 covert famases.
I also want to mention the community in general, especially the subreddit, wihch used to be a nice place to talk about this game and share cool stuff. Now it's just a circlejerk full of memes and stream highlights. No other community on reddit exchanges as many downvotes as /r/globaloffensive.
Overall?
+Great gameplay
+Splendid performace and optimization
+Interesting game modes
+Competetive can both be fun and tense
-Toxic community
-Constant smurfers & cheaters
-Unstable matchmaking
-Unfair cooldown system
-Ridiculous anticheat

I was so proud being a higher rank than all my friends. I felt so good. Then I played faceit for the first time, with around 15 competitive wins so far. It was me, and my friends. British friends. I thought this would be easy, but who knows I thought this was just like regular MM. Then we got 16-0'd. I couldn't turn a corner without getting rekt. 
     Time went on and I found myself with 20$ on my steam. I got 2 normal Global Case Keys and opened 2 cases. Whatever it was, it was ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, I got an AWP | Pit Viper, an M4A4 | Urban DDPAT, and a bunch of other crappy stuff.
     This would eventually turn into an addiction. I got my friend knife. A Flip Knife | Scorched (FT) I was so happy. Then I got scammed when I learned what a ""Blue Gem"" was. My ♥♥♥♥♥♥ blaze pattern AK-47 | Case Hardened (FN) I overpayed a ♥♥♥♥ ton for. But I was happy, and GabeN soon would be too.
      I went on to be given a Karambit Vanilla from a friend, and like, I still had my AK and everything.

730,loopuleasa,35,49,0,True,29.5,"December 1, 2013","Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter. 
The Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source.
I just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which ""Get rekt"" is the only game mode new players can play.
What surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to ""Classic"" and you're set.
As I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here.
Speaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections.
CS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine. 
I haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new ""Competitive"" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure.
The game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast.
I am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too.
All in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Some tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there:
""In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot.
For starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots.
In 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit.
Don't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot.
Play deathmatch at first to train.
What matters, in order:
1) Aim
All weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees.
2) Reflexes
You have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first.
3) Map awareness and predictive thinking
This is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades.""
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run.
Maybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide.
Buy it.
Especially if:
-it's on sale
-you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such
-you have good aim
-you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature

730,Mateoski06,36,51,6,False,"1,380.5","September 24, 2015","After several hours in this game, all I can say is that this game has the absolute worst community I have EVER SEEN in my entire life, and worse than Call of Duty's, Battlefield's, PAYDAY 2's, Team Fortress 2's, or Left 4 Dead's.
CS:GO's community is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the gaming community.
You get insulted by either your teammates or the enemy team for EVERY little thing, on Casual, and ESPECIALLY in Competitive, and you can't mute them either because you have to somehow find some useful information that's buried underneath the childish and immature insults from these manchildren and kids that love talking ♥♥♥♥ because you can't physicallly punch them in the face in real life because of distance.
The virginity, girlfriendless, sexism (I've seen really immature and horny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that prey on girls, and I've also seen stupid, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attention seeking girls on this game as well that bait guys), anti-social, fanboyism, nerdism, sociopathy, childishness, manchildishness, and immaturity are at maximum here in this game.
Then there's these clutch or kick nerds that can't ever give you a ♥♥♥♥ing chance and are constantly pressuring you and cause you to fail, then they put up a votekick against you and kick you out for losing ONE round even though you're most likely leading and carrying the entire team, and winning the match as well, and it's worse if you're in a Competitive match when this happens because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown system, which is another issue with this game. You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that ♥♥♥♥ can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.
Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.
This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.
Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much to you.
And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. 
And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and ♥♥♥♥ you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.
Valve clearly doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).
Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?
I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this ♥♥♥♥ actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.
This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.
I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.
This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.
Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8
And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.
DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated dogshit. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.
It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.
Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.
And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.
Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.
UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community.

730,devonshiremasterrace,20,23,2,False,"1,095.5","December 19, 2014","I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun.
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice.
Having played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame.
Also, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.			"

730,Matthewcp,16,16,0,False,"1,189.2","December 10, 2015","I simply can't recommend this game to anyone in the sad state that it's in. The developers at Valve don't pay attention or care about the effect of the changes they make. The skill ceiling is getting lower with each passing update, and the most recent one is just plain insulting. An obviously broken revolver that anyone with over 10 hours could see is overpowered still managed to make it through QC, along with an unnecessary nerf to spraying. There's no transparency or communication with the community from Valve. If you care about competition at all, this game isn't for you until the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together.			"
730,swamponions,133,222,16,False,237.7,April 7,"Good:
+ Solid competitive FPS with lots of teamwork and strategy
+ Only popular PC game that isn't MOBA garbage
Bad:
- Full of tryhards and constant ♥♥♥♥-talking. Too many people play this game just to rank up and are incapable of having fun.
- Lots of hackers which Valve does a poor job fighting. The worst part is, the prevalance of hackers in this game gives everyone ""hacker-paranoia"" so if you get a few lucky shots you probably end up getting reported.
- The competitive ranking system sucks as it doesn't take personal performance (only team performance) into account. A person's rank is a poor indicator of their skill level because many bad players get ""boosted"" and many good players get stuck at lower ranks by repeatedly getting matched with idiots. It feels like most competitive matches pit you against either terrible players or ridiculously good players (smurfs/hackers), and whether you win or lose is luck of the draw rather than skill.
- Knowing the map layout is too crucial to winning. If you don't memorize all the bizarre callouts, and know the map layout like the back of your hand, people will think you are an idiot. The result of this is that many people end up only playing Dust 2 to avoid having to spend hundreds of hours learning map layouts.
- It's made in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Source engine, which is 12 years old, which also happens to be the average age of people who play this game.
It's not a bad game but it doesn't deserve it's massive popularity. Valve has become totally complacent because they make more money off virtual skins in this game in a month than they ever made off actually making good games.			"

Matchmaking brings a real interest in the game by providing a constant increase in its level and offering games based on its level through the presence of a rank system, it is increasing or decreasing the contrary based on win / loss matches obtained.
The acquisition of different badges and trophies displayed on their profile and the ability to get weekly boxes to receive new skins for its weapons is a complete success and brings a real interest in the game.
In addition, every quarter a new operation allows us to discover completely new maps and fill new goals for a new badge.

730,WitteCS,26,34,4,True,"6,392.4","August 12, 2014","Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.
Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.
What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.
Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.
As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.
The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.
It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.
If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.
There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.
At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.
When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us.
This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.
And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.			"

Game is all about luck, not skill based like all previous versions of the game. Ranked up to DMG with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person COOP. You should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know won't troll you, regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates.
The hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions, due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve.
The skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone. 
As with all games you can trade in, this one is full of scammers. Constantly, daily trying to scam your high value items from you. Procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you don't know. 
This game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system, costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment. Gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run. I believe there is no regulation of this system and there's plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system.
Alot of reviews have complained about cheaters. This isn't such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over VAC in the competetive section of the game, blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank.
Overall the game it's self has a great system but just isn't being used to its full potential. Allocate more time and money please valve.

I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...
CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.
It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.
Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.
Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream “deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better”. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them!
About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. “you guys suck, why are you even playing this game?” or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, “you're such a hacker, it's so obvious” when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems.
It's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. “Spray at feet, get headshot” is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game!
Counter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now.			"

I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases.
There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance.
As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game.
Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping
Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching
Hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb
Aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated
If you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out:
You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits.
You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill
You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly.
You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server)
You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof.
You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die.
All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, ""Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions"" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, ""good"" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation.
An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment.
People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago?
3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind.
This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable.
It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.			"

This game was very fun yet frustrating to play. I learned and got better and at the same time kept learning new things like controlling recoil and how to aim better.
Over time tho this game hasent been doing good (to me at least) In my personal experiances from the 600+ hours ive played this game (300+ on this account and 300+ on my other account) this game has gone through a lot of crap.
Let me get started about what I see people complain about, and myself included. First the 64 tick servers, valve generates millions of dollars, probably even more I dont really know, but I dont know why they dont upgrade VAC servers to 128 tick, it will really make people happy and possibly even attract more players.
Another thing that people complain about is the infamous hitboxes, everyone has had their fair share of hitbox ""mess ups"" as i like to call it, basically to valve shooting someone in the chest 5 times with P250 is actually shooting him once or twice.
This game is fun, it requiers practice and skill, and I like that in a game, but what I dont like is how they dont really fix the hitboxes and bullet regestration and the whole 64 to 128 tick server.
Another problem is Smurfs/Hackers. Everyone knows that hackers are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who like to ruin the game for others and make you get real toxic, mean while smurfs are the same thing but they are legit and have worked to rank up and gain skill, then just ranking down or getting a new account to face lower level skilled people to ruin there day and making everyone look like fools.
What I dont like is that the updates that were supposed to help the smurf problem didnt do much because almost every game I join I see 1 person getting headshots from long killin a guy thats all the way at A site. Its possible but I dont think a silver can do it that easily....over.....and over......almost every round.
I dont get salty or toxic to often as I always remind myself it is just a game at the end, but I see an increase with cheaters and smurfs and I dont see them getting rid of.
In the end, this game is fun, its challenging, I like it. But I dont think valve is doing to great with this game.
Hackers/Smurfs are still about, some guns have been nerfed to the point where its useless, Nuke had the worst map change in my opinion. And to top it all off, 64 tick servers and ♥♥♥♥ hitboxes are the worst.			"

Isnt the competitive goal of players to improve and get better ranks each time? or is it to reach a rank, rage because people at that rank are better than you, and then go buy another account because they can't beat anyone else and prefer to just beat new players? well, the game, is good, the community and the interest of their creators on the competitive aspect of the game, not so much.

730,killerfrosti,17,19,0,True,740.4,"January 30, 2014","Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little ""back to the basics"" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf.
CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (I’ll explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them.
There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played.
So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore I’ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1× kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2× kill reward, a shotgun gives 3× kill reward and a knife gives 5× kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5× kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round.
So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you.
There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this.
In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players.
The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful.
Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.			"

730,portothemeowest,18,21,0,False,117.2,June 11,"TLDR: game with full potential: 7,5/10, game with community on most days: 3/10
What is CS:GO? It is a game that uses mechanics that were last common around the year 2000, or rather around then some mechanics were absent in most big shooter titles that are still absent in CS:GO: no aiming down the sights or zooming in for most weapons, no sprinting, no leaning around corners, no weapon bashing, RNG plays somewhat a role while firing (that is how I explain how I have not killed some people at point blank range but I have scored headshots while jumping around spraying in peoples’ general directions…).
What is good about it? I like the basic idea: short and sweet rounds that require a plan to win. One team needs to secure an objective (most commonly plant and detonate a bomb) in one of two possible locations while the other team succeeds by preventing the former team from reaching their goal. You need to hide well and rotate around the map in a timely fashion. Map knowledge and tactics theoretically get rewarded. This is a game that rests upon a good idea that gets better when playing with cooperative people.
A thing you may or may not enjoy according to your personal taste are this game’s ‘microtransactions’ in the form of weapon skins and operation passes (temporary (!) access to maps and more skins). It is up to you as a player how much, if at all you care about these things. Be aware most of the community seems to be obsessed about these purely cosmetic skins and there are still a few elitists around who hate on people for not owning ‘nice’ skins (just a tip on what to expect from the community, more follows).
What is critically bad about it? Valve do not appear to care about the state of the game, not the least about the community, or do not appear capable to solve its rampant issues.
In the two years I have owned the game little has changed, except for the fact that assault rifles seem to be harder to stabilise (a so called nerf), a major competitive map that got reworked came out worse than before and at some point Valve thought it was a great idea to add a revolver that behaves like a one handed, one shot kill sniper rifle, except easier to handle (much to the dismay of those who care about balance).
Also even in competitive matches I see players with high ping who lag. Match making in general seems to be off. In my own unranked matches I have faced players with almost a thousand hours of experience.
More drastically, instead of finding an effective way to keep problematic players out they have added next to the competitive ranks new XP ranks and a system of cooldowns. So during your first dozens of hours of playing, you will often run into the game telling you you cannot play. Not being allowed to play a game which you have payed for is a feature, a bit peculiar how that works. A better solution  this game really needs in my opinion is a more thorough reputation system that separates the wheat from the chaff.
I have mentioned the basic idea of this game is very good and it becomes better while playing with cooperative players. However these players are becoming (increasingly) harder to find which lowers the enjoyment found in this game immensely. When I start Insurgency, Arma or Verdun I expect to find well behaved people in each session. Queuing for a match in CS:GO by contrast feels like playing Russian roulette. Playing CS:GO on a regular basis requires you to become callous or unpleasant yourself to deal with other players. A match should routinely start with locating the problematic ones and muting and/or reporting these people. 
In the vast majority of matches you should expect to encounter at least one of these categories: a cheater using practically universally available and easily applicable ‘hacks’, a ‘smurf’ that intentionally plays on a lower level than his actual skill group (and hereby denying the chance to other people of having a fair match and ranking up themselves), a ‘deranker’ or group of ‘derankers’ who intentionally make their team lose the match (with or without the full agreement of the team) and finally a troll, ‘griefer’ or other general kind of person who behaves clinically mentally underdeveloped. Only once have I seen someone who I reported get a VAC ban. These cheaters and derankers organise themselves in Steam groups of sometimes tens of thousands of people and Valve do not seem interested in banning or removing these. In general, policing the community is nowhere on Valve’s task list according to my experiences. This poses a major problem for players who cannot rank up due to being defeated by cheaters, smurfs and griefing team mates, hence being stuck in the lower ranks or “Silver Hell”.
Before I summarise this review, a few anecdotes of what concrete behaviour to expect from the community, all experienced over the course of one week.
- On a daily basis: players from the same few language groups of preteen to adolescent age that keep spamming the same expletives in their native languages to you and never share useful information in a mutually comprehensible language. After a while and some googling you recognise the pattern that they are continuously expressing the desire to have various sorts of intercourse with your female family members and so on. Also randomly ‘vote kicked’ by these inclusive groups even if one is the best player of the team.
- Me: “Very nice people, speak English please”. Them: “[rude refusal]”. Followed by a whole match of shouting torturing my eardrums. Instead we could have used sharing information and planning to win the match.
- Derankers throwing mollies at themselves in spawn reducing the length of each round to five seconds.
- Two people claimed to be smurfs, they played with pistols only and when we were miraculously salvaging the match they started committing team kills, tried to get team killed, obstructed team members, initiated random vote kicks, demanded we would abandon our weapons and more such trolling.
- From a certain bunch: “Mother Mary is a pig”, “ISIS attack Brussels, haha!”, “Armenian genocide is big lie”, “suck-a my brown [male organ]”.
- A Twitch streamer with a VAC ban on a three months old acount upon learning I had two friends with me who were new to the game: “gtfo, they’re [feces], NOOB, NOOB, IZI, NOOB, NOOB...”
Number of truly pleasant matches in one week while regularly playing:  one.
I became interested in CS:GO by watching youtubers like Anderzel. However now I feel a bit cheated and I realise these people only upload the one in twenty matches or so that runs its course without problems.
In conclusion, the game itself in theory is easily worth 7/10 at least which is why some well meaning people such as I want to keep playing. In practice this score gets cut in half or worse. Be aware if you want to play and especially pay for this game, you are agreeing that you purchase an experience where you undergo abuse from the socially unadapted in all kinds of languages from all over the world, revealing the true meaning of the game’s name ‘Global(ly) Offensive’.
Some people say it takes over a thousand hours to become truly competent at this game. This game only shines if you play with trustworthy people. If you are not yet committed to this game and you have no four mates to play along, decide for yourself if you want to play something else, go cycling, have dinner dates, play with your children for a thousand hours instead of listening most of that time to overly disrespectful screaming (pre)teens who do not wish to cooperate.

The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:
1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)
2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.
3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.
4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)
Bottom line is that the community is dogshit and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.
The rest of the game is ♥♥♥♥, only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of ♥♥♥♥ community as you possibly can.

730,TheEngiGuy,20,25,0,False,507.5,"December 5, 2015","EDIT: Great game, for sure, and I'm still playing it... but jesus christ do something about smurfers!
Smurfers. My biggest gripe with this game and the reason why I downvote it. I lost count on how many times I got matched against low-life smurfers in higher ranks (who all have 30-40h of playtime or private profile or ""lvl 1 and only csgo in games list"") playing like e-Sports players, beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and my friends (Master Guardian/Gold Nova, so we are not that pro) and even bragging in the chat. THANKS FOR NOT WORKING, MATCHMAKING!
Also, a few times, as gold novas, I got matched against some... high-rank ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Thanks Valve.
The AWP sniper rifle (it's a wall of text because I need to explain). Many players disagree with this one, but in my eyes that sniper rifle is OP. I thought it was ok at first, but I've come to the conclusion that the AWP is just way too powerful. It is 100% accurate, even in the same moment you release the movement button. It kills you in 1-shot even to the body, even if you have kevlar (so what's the point of purchasing kevlar+helmet if most of the enemy team has ♥♥♥♥ing AWPs?!). You don't even have a chance to shoot, since the AWP enemy always shoots first because of the weapon's perfect accuracy.
I have NO problems against assault riflers, but everytime I encounter an AWP, within a second everything turns pitch black! DEAD! When I have AWP, I literally frag most of the opponent team, even when I go run 'n' gun, literally.
Many say ""flank them. smoke them, use flashbangs"". Wish those methods actually worked, but it's a 100% accurate, 1-shot kill, close/long range weapon that is useful in ANY situation. As a terrorists, you don't have much time time to plant the bomb. Flanking makes you lose time, and the maps are a bit small, so escaping is difficult.
""But it's a sniper rifle, it is supposed to kill you in 1 shot because it's realistic you ♥♥♥♥♥♥"". If the game was supposed to be realistic, then all other weapons should kill people in 1-3 shots, right? This is not a realistic game, it's a competitive game, and things need to be adjusted for balance purposes.
Jesus christ most shooters share the same ""op"" snipers, especially in Loadout (a free-to-play game) where you can roll around and still be accurate and kill anyone in 1 shot while assault riflers have to waste an entire magazine AND manage recoil at the same time to kill someone.
Every ""pro"" I see in CSGO only use that weapon. Ohohoh, guess why.
Competitive in this game is ♥♥♥♥ed, and full of nerds who are willing to play 24/7 for the rest of their life just to annoy less-experienced players. Valve, do something for this ♥♥♥♥ system.			"

What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  
I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) 
This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  
The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  
Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. 
Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  
Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! 
Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!
Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh! 
NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.			"

730,birdygurdy,21,27,4,True,"1,412.6","December 11, 2013","Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.
Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.
For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.
Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.
Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire
Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.
If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.
Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.			"

The Terrorists and the counter-terrorists (counter strikers). The terrorists need to make it to specific bomb drop points and hold the position until the bomb goes off. The counter-strikers need to kill the terrorists need to disarm the bomb if it is set or if they kill a terrorist holding the bomb before it is set, they need to make sure no one picks up the bomb to set it. If all members of one faction die, they lose the round. There is no respawn until the next round. All rounds take place on the current map. You don't go to a different map until the match ends.
Since you play a few rounds per game (let's say 15 rounds), you get cash for each round win or lose and you can spend that cash at the start of each round on weapons and stuff. So the game increases as you go from just pistols and knives in the first round to much bigger guns in the later rounds. You can also pick up a weapon off the ground and use it as well (unless you've set the rules to restrict such things). You'll keep the weapon from round to round until you die. Its a nice system.
It is a great game dynamic with good maps that have the right amount of side paths and choke points to cover. The maps are small enough where there will always be some sort of action happening, but large enough where the action can happen at places you aren't.
There is no single player campaign, but you can play maps on your own with bots that have difficulty levels. You can even jump into a bot if you die since there is no respawn until the next round. You'll notice the easy bots take their time to shoot you as well as you can tell watching them they intentionally don't aim directly at you. This is PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS to pick up and play, but of course the bots get more difficult.
The game makes headshots instant kills and goes more along the realism path where if you jump and shoot, you're less accurate. When you kneel and shoot you're more accurate.
It's a fun game that fills a different niche than Team Fortress 2. Give it a try over a free weekend and its also dirt cheap.			"

In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds, with an array of tools such as mic spam, teamkilling, or racist bullet messages. It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old.
Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer.
Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you.
-Ak-47
-M4
-AWP

Pros:
+Has the option of competitive
+Fairly Balanced
+No Game Changing items
+Fair Economy (Skins and Items)
+Easy to setup (Lobbies with Friends, Custom Crosshairs/Changing Viewmodels)
+No way to gain an advantage (Except Skill)
+Good Anti-Cheat and Overwatch
+Teamwork is needed
Cons:
-Very Toxic, occasionally helpful, community. (Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)
-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)
Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!
Neutrals:
(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)
=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)
=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.
Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.
What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:
+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.
Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.			"
730,76561198102533513,15,17,3,True,"1,119.9","December 1, 2015","Well hi and thanks for stopping by.
After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO.
If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull.
What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.
But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.
Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.
When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.
I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.
Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.
Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.
But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.
Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.
Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy ♥♥♥♥ this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. 
Well... what can I say

I believe these issues can easily be solved through a speech recognition test where you're asked to repeat a few sentences for every language you want to approve for, then when people are matchmaking, they can select which language players they want to match with. Other than that, there needs to be some mechanism to support playing as a team, e.g. some detection mechanism to check if people are ecoing when their teammates are, and so forth, and then queue up toxic people with other toxic people and so forth till they fully understand and improve to get out of the hellhole.

________________________________________________________________
New: Okay, after people asking me: ""Hey Axel, why does cs go suck?"", I gotta explain it.
My dear friend, prepare for a long review, full of bad english and hate and ♥♥♥♥ and stuff and... yea, you got it. Let's start with the most annoying thing,
Physics:
Dear Volvo!
Explain me, how to ruin source engine that hard? Corrupting bunny hopping, surfing, sliding (if someone actually remembers this game mod), football, minigames, jail (i dislike jail, but feel free to get angry if you liked it) and worst of all, trikz and kreedz.
Why don't you Volvo release 2 versions of CS:GO? One for fun mods, one for competitive (which is ♥♥♥♥, but i'll come later to it) and feel free to even sell it as 2 different games. I would still buy both and be happy.
why the hell don't weapons have 100% precision now while standing still and doing nothing? Why does every 4th-5th shot with AK miss? Let's make every skill game to a luck game? Like minesweeper, ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""now i need to guess"".
Engine:
Yes, here you'll see all the complaints about tickrate, hitreg and interpolation.
What is interpolation?
As a player, you receive and send packets from/to server to ""communicate"" with the game. These packets contain the information you see later. Your ping is the ""speed"" of how fast you receive the packets. But no one's connection is perfect, so if we only used these packets, the game would lag and be unplayable.
So there is an old trick, interpolation:
You receive a packet, then you receive a second packet and the actual gameplay you see on screen is in between. This means, what you see, happens in the past and the server is a few milliseconds in the future. This is how you get shot with an awp ""while the guy was running just before he shot me OMGOMGOMG TRIQQER HAX"". In reality, the server has already calculated that he stopped and this is why his precision was nearly 100%.
Let's calculate the nice and fun interpolation in MadMaking:
cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate = cl_interp
1 sec / 64 updaterate = 15,625 ms every new packet.
cl_interp_ratio 2 = 2/64 = 31,25 ms for 2 packets to you receive/send so the server reacts.
It may happen that a few packets get lost and hits won't be registered on server but you will see these on your screen.
Now we have lag compensation.
Command Execution Time = Current Server Time - Packet Latency - Client View Interpolation
This means there are small mistakes regarding where the player is and where you saw him and you have to live with it.
Volvo could reduce it to minimum by doubling the server tickrate, BUT higher tickrate means higher CPU load, means higher costs and poor Volvo earns only more than Apple or Google[www.forbes.com] and can't spend more money to get better servers.
You can read more about interpolation here.
And more about lag compensation here.
Microtransactions:
Yes, I totally forgot to mention that in my review, first time i was writing it.
Microtransactions are just another way to make more money by offering unnecessary content. We've already seen enough in TF2.
Volvo thought, let's recreate the same marketing strategy again. And skins came out. Of course, what else could you do?
Creating new paid weapons? Community would tear you in pieces, dear GabeN, because CS:GO is meant to be competitive and there is nothing competitive in pay2win.
But money is not everything! There are even more reasons to add skins. There are people out there who love trading and collecting this ♥♥♥♥ (not to mention people who just buy em for e-♥♥♥♥♥).
Then there are operations. If not to mention that maps are often unfinished, some are buggy, the idea is not that bad. You pay for the coin and that coin gives you stats. But again, there are missions to do and completing a mission gives you a drop - really? The marketing strategy strikes back, even more when you get a case drop as a ""reward"".
Even DLCs are not that bad compared to skins. Why not making unfinished map DLCs like EA or Activision already do?
Microtransactions suck.
Casuals:
First of all, thank you for adding a new game mod called ""Demolition"". It's quite fun when you want to waste your time on fast paced maps. Thank you for adding ""Deathmatch"" as a game mod, to play on official servers.
But how did you ruin the gun game? ""Arms Race"" now puts better players in disadvantage by highlighting them red. Of course it's better for new players to find these. It's maybe fun untill you get matched versus non silvers who start wallbanging you. But to the hell with casuals, we have competitive nowdays built in CS:GO.
Competitive:
First of all, I am global myself and have played CS for 15 years now. And I can tell, I expected more. Global, yes, global must be global. You do get matched with people, I can't say they deserved global. I barely see the difference between eagle and global. Yes, these people are slightly better, but still only people. I expected to play vs people from high tier and not someone who ends his game with 3/5/25. Yes, some people have bad days, are sick, whatever. But this happens way too often.
Competitive bans are a joke. I trolled 100 games and got reported 9999 times. Where is my ban for griefing? I never got one.
Of course there are alternatives as ESL (which is dead in cs go, soon just dead) or ESEA. What do we have matchmaking for, then?
Also, it happened quite often that when Steam servers went down, I finished MM and couldn't start a new one, because ""still in game"". And you abandon it and get your 10 mins ban.
Smurfs, I have no problem with these since I got 6 smurfs myself. Anyways, all the new protection systems are useless, since if I want to play with friends, I do so.
Cheaters, the only thing I am positive about Volvo are VAC waves. Honestly, I think this is where CS:GO made a positive progress. Of course there are cheaters out there, there will always be. But VAC bans are perma. I could wish for was that CS:GO would cost like 100€, so it'd be actually painful to buy it again and again for cheating.
Conclusion:
You ruined CS:S once in 2010. You still do ruin CS:GO. With horrible skins, with people who play competitive for fun (actually you people, ♥♥♥♥ off this game and play competitive for fun in Call of Duty), with engine ""tweaks"" and everything I called above + sending most people to the ""new"" CS.
Oh, one more point. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing easy. It's easy as hell, there is no easier version of CS out there and there will hopefully never be. It is made this way so Volvo can sell it to 6 year olds and profit for it. Because getting pwnd is not fun, but the easiness factor is just made by money.
- This is why bhop is dead!
- This is why trikz/bugs are dead!
- This is why they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the engine!
- This is why competitive went full casual!
- This is why you play this game!
You, dear review reader, are the reason why good games die. Because you want to win and master a game in 10 hours. You don't want to ♥♥♥♥ around and master every engine exploit.
You better go cry into a corner about ""that one guy was bhoping"", ""the deagle is too op"", ""this game has too many cheaters"" and ""the ban system is unfair, I got banned for 7 days, because my internet died ONCE"". Do your thing guys and ruin vidyas.
Peace!
TL;DR: Perfect game for all CoD fans. Only problem is you can't zoom with AK, but you'll get used to it, I promise.			"

730,einfachnurhardc0re,28,41,0,True,"1,134.3","November 30, 2013","CS:GO mixes up Source and CS 1.6 gameplay.
The recoil and the flashbangs are more 1.6 like and the rest is pretty much Source.
In CS you have no aim-down-sights-feature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots. You can also learn the gun's spraypatterns by holding down fire-key and noticing the bullet-impacts (on distance they aren't really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well). In long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right, shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head (unrealistic.. but interessting and challenging). You can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision. You will be slow and more vulnerable. Flanking is hard in this game, because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear, mostly open ways. You can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility (It's a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals). Mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitch-positions. 
In this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners. I think leaning would be a nice addition but no.. this game is still remains classic.
Armor is more helpful than it was in Source. To me it feels like it's more important to land headshots. Because of that it's rather unlikely to get wallbang-kills. It's hard to spray, there is not much hit-slowdown and armor is very powerful.. and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random.
The sound in this game is good. You mostly hear exactly when people run, shoot or jump. You can mostly locate loud players really precisely (unlike in most modern games, where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound.. because of perks for example). Counter-Strike is mostly comprehensible.
Some maps got a really nice overhaul (dust2, dust1, aztec, office, militia, mirage).. Train and Cobble are very different compared to Source or 1.6. Personally I don't like them that much.. Inferno is very similar to the Source-version (they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes). 
It's good that Valve changed the hostage rescue mode. Now it's more tactical and more objective based, but I think this mode doesn't work that good with the old map layouts.
It's sad that there are only very few new competetive maps. Instead of new official maps there are buyable community-mappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time.
The ability to find or buy weapon-skins is new in CS:GO. On the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns, on the other hand it's bad that you mostly find bad looking and/or bad quality skins (or cases). Most camos look  very colourful and not realistic. If you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money (on the steam marketplace).
Conclusion:
CS:GO is a new CS with mediocore graphics (the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better, sometimes the bloom- and post-process-effects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better), reworked maps, new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns (but it's fine). It has most things that the old CS-games already had but also some new things. 
There is ranked matchmaking, a great HUD and an easy to use replay-function. It's also very nice that you still have dedicated servers. You have the possibility to make your own maps and use server-mods. These are all great features that every modern FPS game should have.
If you want to customize the look of your guns, you will have to pay for it. It's very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skin-drops is limited to 2-8 drops per week. 
All in all I think CS:GO is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way. It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. Since this game is not too expensive I can recommend you getting this game.			"

Our tale begins in the later months of 2014 maybe even going in to 2015. I was playing Garry's Mod, when I saw my friends playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They told me it was good, fun, tactical, good shooting mechanics, good servers, good community, good graphics, and EVEN BEST GAME N/A! Maybe a day after, I went to my local Walgreens and got myself a $20 Steam card. I got home, typed the code in, and......... made the worst mistake of my life. I hit the purchase button for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and I had no idea what I was getting in to. Everything my friends said,good, fun, tactical, good shooting mechanics, good servers, good community, good graphics, were lies. After wasteing 20 sum hours of griding casual games, I was rank 3 and ready to play my first competitive match with my friends. 10 games past, I got my rank, Silver Elite Master. My friends were gold nova and we continued to play, The tale now goes dark.

All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs.

CS:source was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive CS and turned the game into a casual shooter.
Then CS:GO came.  This game was made solely for micro transactions, but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on. But the game has no major changes from cs:source other than skins and cosmetics. Furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2. Bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit. But hey, if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest. Another problem are the guns. None of them are balanced in the game. Most famous one being the awp, the 1 shot 1 kill weapon. And last we have the matchmaking. It is some of the worst matchmaking I have ever seen. Any game where it takes over 5min. to get into a match fails, and cs:go has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam.
And lastly the main reason I hate this game, is the community. So I was on a server, everyone was dead. It was me vs. the entire other team and as you would guess, I died. Then some squeaker yells over the mic ""what the f#ck you idiot!"" and starts a vote kick on me that passed. The other way around happened where I hid in a corner no one checked and shot the entire enemy team and won and I get ""You f#cking hacker!"" and get kicked.
This stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name. On top of that this game is full of Russians that like to yell. A lot. Now you would think that when you play on a west coast server Russians wouldn't join because bad ping, but they do. And then you would KNOW Russians wouldn't join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping, but they still do. It's almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all. 
30% of all the nearby servers, at least where I live, are idle servers and even then there aren't that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this, at least to what steam says in their stats. And lastly this game is full of cheaters. And having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your k/d ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat. And having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon.
This game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$. With that said I'm done. I would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions. And yes, ik, my opinion is shÃ­t and i'm an under-aged-pleb that clearly knows nothing about video games. No need to sprinkle your salt in the comments.			"

730,Ov3RT4K3R,20,27,0,True,909.6,"December 22, 2014","Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the newest version of the well known game Counter-Strike.
Global Offensive has a lot of different game modes besides of the classic bomb defusal/hostage rescue scenarios.
Deathmatch, basically is about getting a lot of kills and dying as few times as possible. You will spawn at random space with your chosen weapons or random ones.
In Arms Race you have to get kills with every weapon. The fastest player wins.
Demolition can be a Bomb mission or hostage rescue on smaller maps compared to the regular bomb or hostage missions.
Competitive is the hardest and most interesting type and is only recommended for advanced players. You have to win a minimum 16 rounds to win the game. This gamemode may take up to 90 minutes. Communication is the key here to win.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also support ingame items, but it is a purely cosmetic thing.
You will also have a chance to support the game by buying special tickets for the so-called ""Operations"". With an operation pass you will get access to newly released competitive maps, new weapon skins and an upgradeable medal.
The graphics are much better than Counter Strike Source. The environments are more detailed and the game just looks a whole lot better.
Global Offensive is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam right now, so there are plenty of players and servers.
The mechanics are different from former Counter-Strike games, like the recoil for each weapon and new weapons like decoy, Molotov, etc. This could be difficulty for veteran players at the beginning. But after a while you can deal with it.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a definite buy for anyone that is into Counter-Strike. It is definitely worth the regular price of 13,99â‚¬.
A must have for every Steam user!

3.) Use public and private hacks to boost fellow indians
4.) Get VAC-banned like a boss and buy another CS:GO on other account. Jump to casual and use same hack showing small ♥♥♥♥ is to all the people
5.) Play like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, buying smoke and other nades but never using it on time.
6.) Votekick the person who is angry on his team and telling them to focus on minimap.
7.) Votekick the person who is noob.
8.) Votekick the team-person who is good player and owning enemy team without hack.
9.) Game sense like rice, no sound sense, network spikes to 500 ping but still awping, getting 10 fps on all maps.

730,spitora,15,18,0,True,696.6,"April 26, 2014","Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.
Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. 
Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10			"

For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon).

"
730,DarknessRush,15,18,2,True,"2,398.8","January 25, 2014","This game is amazing!
I was a Call of Duty player and after some time I realized how bad it actualy is, so I thought I need something new and I saw this game on sale and I though why not?
And it was awesome!
First at all the matchmaking works as it's supposed to you most likely wont be matched against players which are alot higher skilled then you are, it has its fair share of problems though for most people. (including the tick rate of the servers)
Like smurfs on the lower, middle and higher ranks silver, gold nova, master guardian, legendary eagle, and the cheaters also know as ""hackers"" on supreme/global.
But there all alternative's to valve's matchmaking, for example, Faceit which also has its fair share of tryhards.
Cevo which is in general good and easy to use.
And Esea, which is the best of all of them, but it's paid.
Second you need a lot more skill and teamwork for this here is an example, when you're on the Terrorist team you need to plant the bomb at site A or B, which they can take by using smokes flashbangs, moletovs.
Or you can go full beserk and charge in with your p90.
You need quite some skill and a good eye to play this game because you can't aim down your sights, you need to learn the recoil patterns, which was bit troublesome when I just started this game.
On the other hand, in this game headshots are alot more important, and you will need to learn to keep your crosshair at head level at every second possible.
Which of course will quite take some time to get used to, but if you master it the satisfaction of a Desert eagle headshot will be better each time you improve on the game.
You also have gamemodes like deathmatch and arms race which need an small improvement on the spawns but after all it's a great way to improve your aim and learning your recoil patterns.
But it's a good way if you are new to the game to kinda figure out how everything works in terms of weapon usage.
Then if you think you have practiced every weapon, you might wanna move on to ""demolition"" or ""casual""
Which are moving a bit to the competetive side of CS:GO.
I highly recommend avoiding casual, since it's basicly just a big gigantic mess.
If you wanna start going to the competetive side of CS:GO play a bit of demolition with your friends, you will start learning to work together which is pretty much the goal of this game.
The maps are good as well, altough I find myself enjoying vertigo as much as any other map, but I think inferno needs to be tweaked especialy on bombsite B.
The maps are good for competetive play.
You can even earn some money out of it  by getting camo's A.K.A ""skins"" and cases and sell them on the market, or as I prefer to trade them with a little profit if possible.
You can also place bets on teams, where you can make some money with, if you prefer to go big you can of course go to jackpot website's.
So far I made like 250 euro's out of it and bought new weapons for it, how AWESOME is that!?
but now I'mcomming to a verdict I'm giving this game an 10/10

Pros
-Recoil
-Balanced maps (well most at least)
-Competitive Community
-You can run a game even with a crappy computer 
-With the VAC system, Hackers get what they deserve
-Skill is required
-Community mods
-A special gun for everyone
-Footsteps
-Strategic in ways such as using flashes and smokes
-Easy to play and get into
Neutral
-Skins, many people will say how skins don't matter and they are 'opinional' but personally who would want to play with default skins, no one would use stock skins so Valve encourages people to 'buy' keys and gamble away their skins in uncasing and bets. I honestly don't know if this is a con or not since Valve does encourage people to put more money into skins than the game itself. 
Cons
-Hackers
-Smurfs
-People can be salty
-Debatable if some guns are OP
Overall, the game is a fun game and worth your money although if I recommend it, you will probably get involved the gambling scheme Valve proposed.

After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than .
Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game.
The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO.
Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies .
But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day .
But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends.
Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion.

1: Smurfs. So many that its not even fun anymore. Once you are higher up in the ranks you will encounter at least 1 smurf per game and they will destroy you.
2: Hackers are very abundant all throughout the game. You will most likely run into a hacker at the very least once every 10 or so games. If you legit think that there are not many hackers in this game, you are sorely mistaken.
3: The community is worse than CoD's community nowadays. They will make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t arguments about the guns, troll, among other things. It is sad just how low some can go, if you want to see that low, this is the game for it.
4: Horrid matchmaking system. I get it, you can only do so much, but from the amount of times I have been paired up with people i should not have, or been put into russians servers, its just stupid.
5: Boosting. So many horrible players have been boosted by their friends, or hackers, or both into the high ranks. Then when you play with them they are worse than a bot for your team. 
6: 64 Tick servers and horrible hit reg problems. The servers are not good, you will encounter many times when you saw your bullet go through the person you were shooting at simply because what your client saw, and the server saw, are two different things. For a fast paced shooter such as csgo, that is very very bad.
All in all csgo was fun, i enjoyed it for a time. That time has long since past. This game could be one of the best of its kind if somebody showed it some proper TLC. Fixed up VAC, upgraded the servers. Helped prevent smurfing to some extent. Now im not somebody with their head in the clouds thinking that everything in this game could be fixed and it would be a perfect game. No, that is not realistic, some of the problems do need fixing though. Maybe one day Valve will care enough to solve them, but i find that to be highly doubtful. If you are looking to become angry, get violent with strangers and friends alike, want to have a stroke and lose your hair through either stress or you pulling it out yourself, this is the game for you.
Edit:As of 3/29/2016 there are even more hackers than before. Wallers are in about every 1 in 3 games. Most of them don't even bother hiding it that well due to bans being so avoidable in this game. Ever since polyhacks were released to the public people have been walling like crazy. Don't believe me? thats ok go look on m p g h and see the massive hacking community at work.			"

As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.
No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.
For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad. 
Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into? People getting CRAZY about chargeable SKINS that only aesthetically make a difference? You tell me.
Anyways, enough of that crazy ♥♥♥♥, opinions are opinions, right?
Controls are okay, graphics don't matter anyways, teamplay is strong, skill is required, what else to say? I think there are enough reviews about the actual game mechanics other than the critizised points listed above, so let me be your hero and skip that part. 
I haven't written reviews in a while, so let's end this one as it would fit into the CSGO Community.

This game comes free with : More hackers
Alot of ppl screaming and cursing in russian.
People who claims they have slept with your mother.
Unfair matchmaking.
Tons of updates.
But realy now: The game fixed alot of issues 1.6 had and makes it one of the world best competetive game ever. I'm glad they added the workshop until i found out that the only way to use an item in the workshop is when it gets imported by Valve in the game.
So that is one problem.
Instead of doing it the way left 4 dead 2 was doing the workshop became a toy making factory because the majority of the people upvotes Borderlands 2 style of weapon camo's.
You will finaly see yourself spending alot of hours consentrating on the screen and doing workout with your fingers. When i bought the game it was playable on my laptop with around 40-75 fps. After the workshop update it got worse every time. now i can barely get 30 fps.

730,sosch,13,15,0,False,352.8,"January 30, 2015","I try to make this as short as possible, but there will still be some lines of text:
I bought this game near the date of the release. My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games.
Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun.
BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"".
After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others.
You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review.
I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?!
I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do.
To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers.
This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve!
And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"".
So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system.
This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture.
You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins.
This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame.
By the way:
Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system.
Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days....			"

The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.
Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.
Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker.
This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this.

Community-I bought this game on a whim, I heard from everybody about how good it is so I decided to give it a try. My first game I had to listen to some guy yell at me because I did not know what I was doing. I quickly just brushed it off and went to another lobby after the game. I encountered the same exact thing. The community complains about how outsiders look at the game and that is because the community drives them away. Don't get me wrong, there is the occasional nice guy/girl that will help new people but they are few and far between. Do not even get me started on the cash grab that they call crates and weapon skins.
Gameplay- The game has a steep learning curve which I enjoyed at first. But then the errors of the game became a little more clear. There were obvious hitbox issues when I played, which of course people will say is due to skill, and the shot registration just felt sub par for a game held on such a high pedestal.
Gamemodes- The gamemodes are simplistic and easy to grasp onto. It took me a round or two to understand  the objective. I have no complaints about the gamemodes/
Price- Yes I understand thast this game was just $15 but you can not defend a game just because you didn't pay full price. That is like if somebody goes out to eat and they have a gift card, and then all of the sudden the food isn't as good as they usually make it because he is paying less. There is no justifiable reason.
Verdict- I gave this game a chance, I would say that 8 hours is plenty long enough to come up with an opinion. I never go home and think to myself ""Lets go play some Counter Strike."" If I do play it is because my friends pester me about it. I can see where people can enjoy the game but it is just not the game for me.

It's not only competitive, it has side games in community servers like Trouble In Terrorist Town, Bunny Hopping, Surfing, etc. 
This game can give you a great advancement in your mental state. You need patience to be an AWPer, You need extra time to train for weapon sprays, reaction time, aim, and just plain pratice to get better.
Casual:
10 on 10 Bomb Mission, great for getting to know the maps because if you are new and bad/and or do not kow what your doing nobody will care. Very Fun, and can meet some interesting ""Characters"".
Demolition:
One of the mini type of gamemode in Counter Strike: GO.
This is a 5 on 5 Bomb Mission with only 1 bomb site. Once you get a kill the next round you upgrade to a better or worst weapon. I use this for pratice or if a friend needs help.
Arms Race (Gun Game):
This is a pretty old game mode with a new name. Your on a Team Death Match, but every 2 kills you upgrade your weapon.
Deathmatch:

Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed
Now to make it
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.
3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.
4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed
5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.
6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.			"

I think the game has cool and original gameplay. Though it doesn't highly innovate, it stills maintains the Counter-Strike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years. 
Let's talk about the community. About 5% of the people you meet on Global Offensive are really nice people. 95% think they're MLG ♥♥♥♥♥ and WILL kick you if you're not very good. I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team. Makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit.
Seriously, beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends. If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo.
But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun.

730,fishfishbutterbutter,10,10,2,False,366.1,"February 17, 2015","Fact:
Have played CS series since the first, cannot recommend this game. Very broken - you can do anywhere from 11 to 200 damage when shooting someone with a shotgun no matter how well you aim and how close you are, you will see blood pour out of your enemies to have the game tell you you did no damage, and you will shoot someone in the head with an assault rifle and do 2 damage when they do 211 with the same rifle (despite them having no armour or helmet and you do).
Opinion:
The recoil pattern feature in this game is also silly, as you literally have to aim downwards and draw a T shape while shooting to keep your shots on target (Yes, the patterns are essentially fixed patterns)  with the crosshair rather than do your best to keep it focussed on them. Guns which are the same  calibre and similar barrel lengths (sometimes have longer barrels by far) will do alot less damage and penetrate armour worse than more expensive ones. Doesn't make any sense.
This game is very broken and I suggest you just play CSS instead, as it is alot more accurate and features 100 tick servers (over competitive 64 tick, COMPETITIVE). 
CSS is also more expensive by 5 bucks because maybe valve knows that csgo is a complete mess.
TL;DR: CSGO isn't a CS about skill, it is a CS about  rolling the dice everytime you shoot someone.
If you don't believe me then youtube a video of CSGO hit detection, I assure you you'll be amazed at how bad it is.
EDIT: Turns out the game was originally going to be made for consoles but then Valve decided to develop it more for PC instead - Game is a console port too.			"

I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep.
One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict.
I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head...""a csgo addict"". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing.

After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than .
Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game.
The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO.
Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies .
But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day .
But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends.
Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion.

This game would be amazing if it was not for the toxic community that like seeing people rage. This game is based around skill. You have to be amazing to be in global. It does not take skill to be unranked or silver. In a game you have to win 16 rounds to win a game or 15:15 which is a tie. The best gun by far is the p90. Everybody loves this weapon.

  First of all, the game respects to the original Counter-Strike soul. What I mean with that; Close combats, mid-range combats, long combats, auido, personolized CFG, grenade training, team-work, using communications are still have great affects on the gameplay. 
  So far what has changed? First, graphics and phsycs has changed. Weapons has changed, community has changed, players has changed, match-making has changed. I will explain everything what i mean by those but first things first. For old players from the times of 1.5 or 1.6 (or even older) You may difficulties adapting to phsyscs and new gameplay. As I said players has changed, and the teamwork has changed. There will be a lots of people telling you what to do. Why are you flashing, why did you smoke there, how didn't you heard the defuse but believe me you will understand that all after a few hours on the game. With the new ranking system ( I will explain this furter too.) there is much at stake. Your efforts and skills will affect you teammates ranks in competitive mode.
  Let's start to explain; 
Matchmakin Mode (Competitive)
5 to 5 serious matchs, instead of an 32 player 16-16 server which people often go crazy run around, rushing CT's. You will experience a real clan match. For example, after you accept the game on Dust 2 if you leave the game you will have a punishment for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 7 days. Same punishments for killing to much teammates or killing a teammate after the spawn. 
  After you have won 10 games in competitive mode you can see your rank.(Search google for further reading.) Ranking system is a revoulitoun for me. Like in chess you will face with opponents in your same skill level and that also offers a chalenge: To up rank but also there is a risk to de-rank. Ranking system works on different ways and have a lots of different derrivatives. For example winning matches while the opponents have higher ranks then you or having a 37-5 K/D. Believe me ranking system is your friend
Weapons
Remeber the times that AK-47, M4A1, AWP, Desert Eagle were over power? Forget it and also say goodbye to a lots of weapons including MP-5 (one of my favs.) Goodbye to scout... 
Say hello to PP-Bizon, SSG,P250,Nova...
With these changes you'll have a very expanded area of weapons to chose, MAG-7 is op in close combat, SSG has its pluses such as you can shoot straight while jumping. five-seven has a great armor penetration CZ-75 is an automatic pistol that you can rush with in an eco round. The reason im telling you all these because you can choose your own weapons considering you style. Are you a rusher? Get your P90 ready 50 bullets, low recoil high fire rate, you are a close-holder, get a mag-7, you are good on sniping and pistols? get your ssg. Options are much better then it was in 1.6 or else.
Also do not omit the skins and market. over 100 skins for weapons, 10 different weapon boxes near 30 different collections. Trade up contract, keys, operation bravo-phoenix. Thats not something that I can explain. You need to see it yourself and feel the difference. 
Audios are better, community updates every second, you can report cheaters, phsycs are nearly awesome then every other fps games. (yes including CoD). 
Go and get the game, do not wait for price to go down. You can make that money in game with selling weapons on the market for the time being.  
14.99$ for this game is like paying 40.000$ for a masseratti. (And masseratti doesnt helps you to make your money back.)
Trust me if you are searching for a great fps experience, this is the most exciting game for time being.

So many things I want to talk about:
GAMEPLAY
This is alot like Counter Strike 1.6 and has so many unique features I enjoy. I'm glad this game didn't come out like Counter Strike: Source which was terrible. This game has intense sound effects that play when the bomb is planted, at the beginning/end of rounds, when you win/lose, and when you get an mvp. The guns and their spray patterns are fun to learn and take alot of time and skill to master which is good (not a cod fan). Like all Source games you can change crosshair, sound settings, video settings, and tons more through the console. The guns feel exciting to hold and shoot. Everytime I pick up an AK47 I feel fireworks going off in my head. This game gets very intense and based on teamwork. If you do not have someone to play I recommend finding someone to play with since alot of people in competitive play aren't always nice.
COMMUNITY
The community of Counter Strike is amazing. There still is that 40% of people that like to mess with people and hate just like any other community, but CSGO's community has many coders and other people trying to help VALVE locate bugs and exploits in CSGO which is awesome! They are helping make a better game. CSGO's community also has very talented artists who do skins for the game. Some of the amazing skins to make it in have been the Hyperbeast, Cyrex, Neon Rider, Asiimov, and more! Alot of people love Counter Strike and so many new gaming networks/sub communities have started through Counter Strike. The community also has fun gambling websites where you can gamble skins away on pro games.
RANKS
This is a very important part of the game that has been ruined by multiple vac wave bans. After all these people were banned from CSGO everyone started ranking up 2-3 ranks. Most people in their rank should be about 3 ranks lower. Valve needs to fix this! They need to go through and set everyones ranks to unranked, then let people play 5 games to determine their new rank or something. Hopefully one day the horrible rank issue will be fixed.
VAC
The Valve Anti-Cheat detection on CSGO hacks is terrible. ESEA Client has a better hack detection then Valve. Valve needs to fix this right away!!! There are too many hackers in the higher ranks. Most hacks aren't detected until people finally report somebody and they go to overwatch.			"

It's ok to spam the mic like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ little spazmaloid blowing and sucking the mic with pure excitement that he's annoying people and he doesn't get kicked after 3 different people vote to kick him. Me? One quick vote, 4 slow votes yes and I'm outta there! ♥♥♥♥s me right off.
This game cares more about hackers too and smurfing ♥♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ity fuccccccccck
[EDIT]I don't mind losing my rank when I am playing like a noob, fair is fair. But with all this deranking crap happening, I am constantly dealing with hackers/smurfs and people who clearly belong in a higher rank. They should of just introduced some newer rank for the Best players, like Golden Global or something.
Reminds me of when I was at school and they allowed the girls to wear trousers, which was bloody awesome but then the 6th formers cried they wanted to be different from us, so we wasn't allowed trousers any more!
Who gives a :poo: about globals wanting to be on their own in a sepcial little group. Now I have to play with special needs kids and hackers again. Everyone is on a trolling spree cos they don't care about ranks anymore. I don't either but what's the point in even playing anymore? Just really irritates me, yes I am ranting, no I don't care and no I am not on my period.
Things I hate about CS:GO:
1, If your're better than anyone (even for just one round) you're a hacker.
2, If you have Russians on your team, you're doomed.
3, If no one talks after warm up ends, you're doomed.
4, If your other 4 teammates talk in another language constantly and you have to mute them, you're doomed.
5, If your pre-pube teammates find out you're a girl, you either get abuse or licky ♥♥♥♥ treatment, also doomed.
6, When your MM teammates can't afford a mic, doomed.
7, When your teammates decide to eat instead of playing by saying 'It's justa  game', you're doomed.
8, When you lose the first round and your teammates insist we are going to lose and it's all over, doomed.
9, If you kill someone with any wep, you're a noob. Then they use the same wep and brag about skill.
10, When the other team are losing.. Silence. When they're winning.. Constant bragging in chat.
11, When your teammates tell you to pick an AWP up and you do, throwing away your own weapon. Only for them to get one off someone else or buy something else, doomed.
12, When your teammates start shooting you at the beginning of every round, doomed.
13, When your teammates are flirting with you and you let out a great big burp, only to be called a disgusting pig and try to kick you. (This is also in 'Things I love about CS:GO')
14, I hate how when a member of your party (you have no idea) gets banned for hacking, you're not told who it was and you get punished (rightly so, but they should name and shame so you can remove the mother ♥♥♥♥ers.
15, I hate smurfs.
16, I hate hackers.
17, I hate cry baby losers with small ♥♥♥♥s and big mouths.
18, I hate kids who cry 'die of cancer!' everytime you kill them
19, I hate  I could go on, but I'll leave it here for now.

The thing is, it is waaaay too long. So when I started doing it, at the half of it, I ran out of place. Couldn't type anymore.
So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)
Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad.
 FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!
One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)
As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :D
But don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^
I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)
The good stuffs about CS:GO:
- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.
The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!
(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.
It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)
Which can be nice to have too! :D
- The game is based on real skills.
Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!
The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!
Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!
- Many maps available.
The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.
Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!
- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!
Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!
- New cases shows up regularly in game.
Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).
What's the good point about that?
If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)
And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.
And one week later, the price would be around $1.
So, try your luck on the first days!
- Last part of the good points:
Rankeds are really nicely optimized.
One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.
If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.
If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.
Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^
If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.
The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.
You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)
But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.
The bans system work that way:
1rst ban: 30 minutes.
2nd ban: 2 hours.
3rd ban: 1 day.
4th ban: 7 days.
Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!
The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! 
It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)
(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!) 
 Negative facts:
 - I'm gonna make it simple..
Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.
Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.
I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^
But, don't give up!
Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.
Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.
- Les hackers.
Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.
Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.
Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.
- Hackers.
Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.
Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.
And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.
- Some players ruining the community.
Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.
But they are not only them.
Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..
It comes from everywhere!
There is no perfect community.
They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAo
Thanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)
Anyway! I am gonna stop here. 
There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)
Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) "
730,DevilBrox89,9,9,2,False,419.3,"December 25, 2015","COMMUNITY 
The biggest problem of this game.  Community is full of Russians, screaming kids, Russians and again, you won't believe me - screaming kids. About 80% (maybe more) of my games I played with Russians was pure cancer. They didn't speak English, just ""♥♥♥♥, blyat"" and other sh*ts.  This also applies with kids - I don't know, how many times I heard 11/12 yo kids who f*cked my mother, funny :), isn't it? You can have a good score, like 36/15, you can win 9 rounds on harder side, you can sacrifice your soul to win, but still, with team score 14/9 on better side you can LOSE. Why, because they aren't able to do something good. 
Situations, when they want to kick you:
They want to kick you, if you don't clutch 1v5.
They want to kick you, if you don't speak their language.
They want to kick you, if you are 30 seconds AFK. 
They want to kick you, if you are ahead of them.
They want to kick you, if you are behind them. ( mostly if  they use only P90)
They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun.
AND STORY CONTINUES........
I really recommend to find a friends and play together.
SKINS
In game you can buy skins. Nice, you can ""upgrade"" your game how you want. But there fun ENDS.

VALVE's RANKING SYSTEM
Another thing you should know until you start play competetive. Believe me, rank in this game doesn't show your right skill. There are a lot of boosted accounts. You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.
VALVE ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM (VAC) 
Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets. 
SMURFS
Maybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man. So, you want check out his profile, clearly for sure and then you see: Lvl 1 profile without avatar, only with 1 game - CS:GO with about 60/100 hours on it. I don't get, why do they create new Steam profile, buy CS:GO and play against weaker players. They gotta to kill lower ranks to get a higher ego? Why do they not play on FACEIT/ESEA? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, if you want to get the cancer, but you dont even smoke and these included cons don't matter for ya - BUY IT! :)
But the game itself is great :)

730,JamsTheChimp,9,9,0,False,"1,209.5","December 10, 2015","The new revolver is stupid. CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. 
Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. 
To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:
Sorry about the rant but this update has been rather disappointing xD			"

730,Boingdom,9,9,0,True,771.7,"August 9, 2015","The ever so popular Counter Strike: Global Offensive
What do i think of this game? Well, to begin with Counter Strike is a very unique FPS game.  i first played this game in spring 2013 on and off. i finally think i have enough experience to write a review. Unlike other fake games we shall not name (CoD, BF) this game requires some knowledge and skill to play. 
Pros:
Counter Strike does not require a super beefy computer and can be played with a average set up and hardware
Counter Strike has a ""decent"" community and most players are friendly to the other players (i said ""decent"")
Counter Strike is not a pay to win game, you are not required to pay money and keep playing, the Operation passes are to support the devs and help keep the game going.
Counter Strike has a growing community and you should be able to find competitve matches quickly (depending on the maps you select)
Counter Strike has Dust II, Dust II is the best map every created for Competitive level of gameplay.
Counter Strike is not FTP, if Counter Strike was FTP the community would crumble
Cons:
Counter Strike has had problems with Smurfs in the past, the problem has been fixed a little bit, but there are still some smurf problems. Smurfs can ruin a entire game and i know some players who quit playing because of the Smurfs
Counter Strike has some hacker and cheater problems, i have played many games where i have run into a cheater. Cheaters ruin the game and it is no fun to play with cheaters.
(There are some players who will play without a mic, grief, or throw games, this mostly occurs at lower levels, however i have not run into many of these players)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are my thoughts on the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive
I would really suggest giving this game a try if you have not tried it before

730,76561198015641338,9,9,0,True,"1,124.2","June 12, 2015","I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.
Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value.
 One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.
The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself.
 The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does.
 Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.
The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this.
 I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.
So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.
On to why the game is good.
The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game.
 Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. 
While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.
All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter.
 There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.
I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.
A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. 
It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.
I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you.
 Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating.
 You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.
It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)
I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.
Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.
So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.			"

In CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive) I love how there are camos/skins on weapons because no other game is like it. I also love how they're are a workshop where you can create skins, maps, stickers, ect. CS:GO also has a lot of people playing it so if you are playing on a random server, you are guaranteed to have other players on there. The fact there are servers ""you"" can make.
What I dislike:
The fact there are smurfs that play with silvers and just make there games horrible. I mean this is not me since I'm not in Silver I'm Master Guardian, but that has nothing to do with this review. Anyways I dislike how they removed Operation Vanguard from the maps because I loved Season and Workout a lot. I know you can still get the maps off the workshop and still play it, but it's just not the same. I think valva should add more things to do in the tutorial so begineers understand more about the game.

730,heisenborgo,11,13,5,True,"1,529.1","October 29, 2015","Lets be honest lads - if you want some top class competitive play you know there's only one PC game that lives up to the T-Stone Standards gold edition. If you want some cracking banter then this is definitely the top dog. CS:GO nails it in every aspect - from teamplay to pulling the bolt back on guns to waste the bullet in the chamber, but that's another story.
Let's have a bit of a backstory shall we lads? A bit of a big boy Borgo story coming up. CS:GO started as a ♥♥♥♥ing disaster - lets be honest here. It was a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ developed by Hidden Path entertainment. It disappointed fans around the world, including myself. As soon as I loaded up the game I was met with 3 buttons and none of them gave anything interesting. The only one worth pressing was ""exit game"". Being 6""3 tall this was completely unacceptable. 
Fast forward 6 monts and Valve takes the steering wheel with their greasy mits, just like me in the Golf mk5. The game takes a massive turn around, as if it was touched by the hand of midas. Let's be honest though boys, it was all down to those skins. I remember buying my first as if it were yesterday - the gleaming AK Fire Serpent. The £27 left my wallet and was sent straight to Valve's pocket (which was soon to be filled to the brim by Flimp Stonk, but again that's another story). I loved it - it was perfect. It was followed by a Gut Knife, and like myself, other players began to find a new love in the game because of colourful guns. 
The game was fixed up over time, and the competitive scene really took off. With each Major came an extra truck-load of viewers;  the fans came rolling in. Today, the members of SadOldGits clan have amassed a large inventory value between them. Blimey, it has to be roughly £1000, enough to buy a clapped out Corsa.
Now we're here - what many critics believe to be the pinnacle of CS:GO's popularity. But they have a point - is there anywhere else to go for the game? What can we expect next? The options for improvement seem to be running out, just like the number of characters I have left to write this review. Can anything more be done with the game? Or is it just going to be another ""operation"" churned out every quarter? It seems now the game has plateaued, it is just smoothing off the rough edges, as the game's future is still a bit grainy like the 5 a side pitch.
Well lets be honest lads, who cares where the game goes next? We've had some great times and for that I've had to give this game a thumbs up. Thanks for reading and I'm now going to play some Fheeeeeeeeeeeeeeefs pro clubs. Cheers.			"

- ELO system is weird had a friend that ranked up after every single win in competitve he is the mvp after every round but i still see no logical explanation of ranking up after 1 game being won in competitive. 
- Matchmaking really bad matchmaking system they have in CS:GO what i can say about the matchmaking system it is a mess literally they just dump random people of weird ranks as your opponent while your own team are beautiful silvers
Take this for instance lost 1 game and next round this happend to me my opponent have 4 gold nova master and a Master guardian I and my yes my team 4 cute little silvers and i am the only gold in that team

So what are interesting and new in CS:GO ???
“Realism”: 
- When pistols 300 and 500 coins price (P250 and Five-seven) instantly kills man with helmet and armor at close range with a single bullet head shot, and a device price 3100 (M4) does not kills man with helmet and armor at any distance with head shot.
- Snipers with SSG 08 kills enemy in jump (!) with a sniper rifle (!!). And it's not a luck / random - this is the norm in the CS:GO.
- Snipers with the AWP that can walk in different directions with 8 kilo rifle with active scope and make kills. This is the norm in the CS:GO. At some 5x5 games number of AWP is 3 or 4 in team. (VALVE ignore players request make AWP like in 1.6 version).
- Some ""brilliant mind"" in VALVE decides add to balanced CS game ... revolver what has same damage like AWP. About 3 years passed from creation, VALVE dont understand, that CS is not just a first person shooter like Half - Life, this a balanced tactic game.
- Shooting in the game is completely different from version 1.6. Greatly simplified shoot from AWP. Greatly had reduced the accuracy of the AK-47, M4. Similar to the parameters M4 from 1.6 became M4A1-S added later, with even then it fixed by removing the damage. In CS:GO combat is now spray control from both sides, as at amateur and at pro levels.
The question arises - why not just transfer the weapons and they parameters from 1.6 to CS:GO???
- Armor piercing .... not bullets, in CS:GO we have armor piercing guns)
Game “drop” and “funny” crates 
- When you play 1300 hours 10-15$ price game and had only consumer and industrial drop items. ONLY. In free to play Dota 2 drop any types of items. Before summer 2015 patch if you played many time, sometimes you may had 1 or 2 drop every day and many crates. But in summer 2015 some “genius” in VALVE decide to “improve” in CS:GO ""funny"" patch: now NO MATTER how many you play: 5 or 125 hours per week – all players have fixed drop – 1 gun skin, and 3-4 crates per week.
In all different games are bonuses for players who play many time. CS:GO unique game where NO MATTER how many time players spend in game for items drop.
- When you open 300 crates, and find ... 1 knife.
“Progressive” rank system at 5x5 mod.
- Nobody knows how it work)
- You with friend bought CS:GO and decide to play 5x5 mod together? Don't hurry: if you have more higher rank that you friend has, you and friend ... can not play together, only 5 man can play having different ranks. If you do not have 5 players - you may never play together. CS:GO is unique game - if you bought game, not a fact, that you will play together 5x5 mod. 
- This system creates a people who really make CS:GO game ugly:
-guys after account rank boosting (they pay to other player, and he boost rank) 
Guys after account rank boosting quite easy to calculate: for example, while playing kid with rank master guardian elite voice the kid 10 years old asks ""guys what is “eco round?”""; when the guy with the rank gold nova master plays ONLY PP Bizon /no armor; when a person with a rank legendary eagle playing with the same ranks as he has finished 0/2/24. How many games have been marred by such friends ""after the boost"" is not counted.
- ""smurf"" - man who has a high rank, and creates a new account for fun/after the ban or for account rank boosting for other player)
Of course there will be little pleasant when the map where plays silver rank players comes Smurf with real rank legendary eagle, especially for the team against whom it came. The most interesting is that the account boosting is quite a legitimate thing. Nobody cares that it may spoil the game for many people.
For these problems has only one simple solution – hide the rank, for only game system can check you rank. Smurfs and guys after account boost will disappear forever. I don't believe that VALVE can not make this simple solutions since 2012.
""Super"" anti cheat protects all VALVE servers))
- ban cheaters after... 2-3 months game. (or don't ban in general)
- VALVE agree that they have a useless anti cheat, and created Overwatch - option, where any player after 150 wins at 5x5 mod can ""judge"" cheaters. They don't create new normal anti cheat, they decide transmit all responsibility fight with cheaters on to players. Other VALVE “great” idea.
  Awful game optimization. Don't be surprised, when you play Battlefield 4 in ultra quality graphics without any lags, but when You playing CS:GO in low quality graphics - game lags/ has freeze.
   Awful CS:GO official VALVE servers. Veterans of the CS serie do not need to tell what it means to play on the server where tickrate, updaterate, cmdrate is 64.
""friendly"" CS:GO community.
- you play ""5x5"" mod. Taking first place with 4 russians in team all time uses foul language (want report them for this? no sense, because VALVE don't ban players for use foul language), and at last win round they....kick you.
- kids screaming at microphone like a group of baboons.
In summary we can say that the new game in the series has turned out an extraordinary, with its pluses and GREAT minuses. 100% i can say, if i knew all those minuses before start playing CS:GO , i never started play CS:GO. CS:GO - really worst game at all serie.
Play CS:GO if you want spend some time playing with friends 5x5 just for fun.
Play CS:GO if you don't upsets when you will be killed in the pit by jumping sniper from A plant (dust2 map).
Play CS:GO if you don't upsets any game results.
Play CS:GO if you don't care about awful game community.
Play CS:GO if you don't care about game realism.
Play CS:GO if you don't care about weapon skins and game items drop.
Play CS:GO if you don't upsets cheaters playing versus you.

730,pyro1290,8,8,0,True,"1,740.1","January 11, 2014","CS:GO is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters out there, it offers such great gameplay and wide variety of gamemodes and maps to choose from. Counter-Strike has been around since 1999, and has grown since then. CS:GO may not please every 1.6 fan, but it has a lot to offer to the Counter-Strike scene. It has official competitive matchmaking, and supports the eSports scene of Counter-Strike. Most Counter-Strike major tournaments are hosted by GOTV and other sources like Twitch (which you can find on the main menu). It offers a ton of new gamemodes you made of heard before like ""Arms Race,"" (AKA Gun Game) and ""Deathmatch,"" (An all out Free-for-all). These gamemodes make Counter-Strike more friendlier to the casual players of the game. The old gamemodes are back in the modes Casual and Competitive. Casual is mostly for pub servers because it offers a more casual experience to the standard Counter-Strike gametypes like de_ (Bomb defusal) and cs_ (Hostage rescue) by turning off team-killing, always buy the essential equipment like Defusal kits and head armor. In the Competitive gamemode, it brings out the standard Counter-Strike competitively accepted settings. (some are modified like: Bomb time not being 35 seconds and instead being 45) This gamemode is for people who want to queue up with their friends and have a serious match with other players in competitive. Team-killing is allowed and many other hardcore settings to please the competitive audience. You might say to yourself, ""Well, since teamkilling is on, doesn't that mean people can grief in competitive?"" Valve has implemented ways to stop griefers and trolls from ruining the game experience. Everytime you team-kill someone, you get a competitive ban that can go up to 7 days, and even a year, which means you can not play the competitive gamemode for how long it lasts! Valve also has its own community Overwatch service, which detects cheaters and griefers. Overwatch lets you watch competitive games and see if someone is griefing or not. The Overwatcher determines if the person is griefing or hacking. Then, the report gets send to Valve for a final confirmation. This has helped the CS:GO community get rid of hackers and griefers off of the competitive scene. Speaking of the community, the CS:GO community is pretty friendly when it comes to new players. Most veteran players are willing to help out to teach everyone the basics of the game if they are having trouble. Many guides on the steam community guide page teaches new players on how to handle weapons and such. I rate this game 10/10, this game is near perfection when it comes to multiplayer shooters and it is a must have for every steam account.			"

- being in a financial crisis because you are addicted to opening cases so your weapon looks a bit cooler

- losing ranked games due to some idiots shooting at team mates for the sole purpose of getting kicked

But then, I always remember the wise words of a Russian teammate (may his soul rest in vodka).
At the start of a round, he told me to ""rush B"" and he advised me not to stop while doing so, dropping me a P90.
I had already acquired an AK-47 at that point, but I decided to play along with him, changing the AK for his P90.
It didn't matter to me that we were actually on the CT side and little did I know that the very same Russian would go AFK soon after. We lost the round, but do I have regrets? Not in the slightest. As a matter of fact, I found it quite enjoyable.
To this day, I continue to rush B, and after countless ""cykas"" and ""blyats"" I heard being exchanged throughout entire games, I began to see a deeper meaning in his words.
""Rush B; Don't Stop."" I recalled the feeling of hope in his voice as he said it, and that is precisely what made me continue playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the hope to achieve something greater.
I hope we meet again so that I can drop him a P90 of my own in return.			"

At first i didnt like it, but now after all the updates and since it got more famous in the editing community then i gave it another shot, and i have to say its a very good game! The recoil might be a bit weird, but youll get more used to it over time. CS:S is the best game ive ever played, so its weird getting used to, but you can master it.
A lot of nice ideas with this game, and the community isnt too bad.
The skins.. Eeerrhhh.. I dont know, but its a genius idea from VALVe and also a goldmine for them.
I do enjoy collecting the skins and stuff, but its not like i want to pay 120Ã¢â€šÂ¬ for a knife skin, thats just ridiculous. But the game is very good and polished, and definitely worth a try if youre a CS fan.
The competitive side in this game is really good, and probably the best side of the game. Its just too amazing at being competitive. One of the most perfect games to play serious in.
A little thing to the bad sides though, when people shoot, and till they actually hit someone seems to be.. weird. Theres a slight delay from shooting till it hits and that is what i find most difficult in this game really, the recoil you can learn to master, but this is just not good.
Editing in this game is ruined compared to CS:S, you cant remove all hud, or well, you can but it can be tricky and it shouldnt be. Also the deathnotice pops up later than in any CS which can ruin hard cutted edits too. And as i mentioned before the delay on the shots also ruin the editing a bit, so yeah.
I dont know what more there is to say other than that i enjoy this game and its competitive side a lot too. I highly recommend this game if you like CS and just FPS games in general.
I would rate it 9/10 JUST because of the delay on the shots, if that werent there, i would give it 10, so please VALVe, fix this if you can and it will be one of the best FPS's ever!

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 
Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

730,venomjackal,16,23,0,True,"1,271.9","December 15, 2013","So Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest revision of the long running Half-Life mod fps. Created by Hidden Path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 1.6, cscz  and css. This is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of COD and Battlefield generation.
You see CS generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled. You'd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the fore-mentioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer. How have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference. The newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined CQC mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bomb/defuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with. For me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if youâ€™re an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes.
The inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the Molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics. Most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps, game types and weapon skins to name but a few. There is the introduction of operation payback  whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play.
So why would you choose this over css for the experienced player. I find that it adheres to the original 1.6 far more closely then css ever did. The aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely. There are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though, such as spectator mode, competition spectators i.e. Dreamhack, newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few. 
For me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode. Ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ED, played pcwâ€™s or cups. Now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out. These include dropped players being replaced by bots, hacking and over watch submissions, uneven rank matches to name but a few. If you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me.			"

730,plasticdisc,9,10,0,True,161.8,"April 12, 2014","Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.
Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.
For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.
Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.
Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.
Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.
If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.
Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.			"
730,greenlemonade,9,10,0,True,979.2,"November 28, 2013","Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at.  
A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).
Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. 
For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!			"

730,malsf21,9,10,0,True,919.8,"March 15, 2014","Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is arguably the best game on the market. Ever.
CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive henceforth) sets new standards for FPS gaming. 
Guns 'n Glory (mostly Guns)
CS:GO, like COD: Whatevercrap, features many guns. CS:GO features two different teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, with distinct armories. Ranging from the classic Desert Eagle, which pwns faces, to the CZ25, a freakin' auto pistol, to the SCAR-20, an AUTOMATIC SNIPER RIFLE, to the infamous AK-47, CS:GO's wide range of weapons allows for adaptable play-style (or in other words, AWP ALL THE ROUNDS). Players can even customize their own guns, naming them, stickering them and painting them with in-game skins. 
CS:GO also features other non-gun weaponry. Grenades are prominent in rounds, from the classic High Explosive Grenade to Flashbangs to Moltovs. Players also can utilise Kevlar Armor and Helmets, which are useful against most guns. Finally, you can tase people. Fun.
Gameplay/Gamemodes
Unlike CS:S and 1.6, CS:GO kicks butt with new gamemodes. Different playstyles are designed with time and experience in mind- now, those without much time can play quicker games such as Arms Race, where players compete to get a kill with every weapon. It moves on to Demolition, a ""simplified"" version of Classic with only one bombsite, and no freedom in what weapons the player uses. Then, we get to the big leagues, with Casual, a drop-in game style much like Competitve, but more relaxed without early-dropout penalties and free armour.
Then, there's competitive. This is where it really gets fun. 5v5 teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, fight to the death to plant a bomb or save hostages. Competitive really brings out teamwork and strategy. Players have to buy guns and armour strategically, and winning counts. Competitve is really the crowning jewel of CS:GO. It even evens out the ""unfairness"" of maps, allowing both teams to play 15 rounds per side.
Graphics/Performance
CS:GO is not at all taxing on computers. I myself own a 2GB RAM computer, and it runs perfectly fine on lower Graphics settings. Other computers, such as that monster 16GB Alienware, can run on high setttings, beautifully visualising the different maps made by Valve and the Community. 
Hats?
While CS:GO does not have hats (damn), it does feature weapon skins and stickers. Deck your own guns out with sick skins, whether it be as colourful as ""Death By Kitty"" for the P90, or as bloody serious as Crimson Web for the SCAR-20. Players can get skins by playing on VAC-secured serverts (nobody likes cheaters), unboxing Weapon Crates with Keys (think TF2), trading with other players, or buying them from the community market. Some guns are *special* (like me!), with StatTrak guns letting players count the kills acheived by the gun, or Souvenir-versions based on pro-tournaments. 
CS:GO also recently added stickers. Players can put stickers on their guns to show support for their favourite pro-teams, support for Eco-Rounds or dancing bannanas. 
Community
CS:GO has an amazing community. The Steam Workshop has new skins and maps for players to try out, and in Operations, Valve adds these wondorus creations to CS:GO. In addition, there is a very supportive community online. Anybody who isn't gets an AWP to the face. Big deterrent.
Overall, CS:GO is a great game. BUY IT FREAKIN' NOW!			"

Вообще, я, признаюсь, ненавидел именно эту часть больше остальных, потому что она была самой мыльной, казуальной и вызывала у меня нешуточный бугурт одной только стрельбой, лол. Бетка попала довольно быстро, но я успел только на предпредпоследнюю стадию беты и последнюю. Тогда она показалась мне, ну, явно не игрой, которое ждет будущее, которое хотя бы отдаленно может у этой игры быть. Оказалось, я ошибался. Мне казалось, что над этой частью просто смеются, вообще ни разу не работают, но время сделало своё.
И действительно, пару раз она заманивала меня в свою ранковую систему (да я и сейчас играю, чего скрывать). Сами обновления действительно интересны, некоторые из них даже привносят существенный баланс, чего я просто не ожидал видеть в такой игре, как CS, тем более Global Offensive. Название заманивает, сами отзывы чересчур позитивные, чтобы отказаться сыграть. А на распродаже, буквально за копейки, её можно приобрести. Тогда-то откроем новую каэс, которая на самом деле новая.
Новые карты, обожемой, верните мне мой старый nuke и train. Этот бугурт можно было услышать и увидеть везде, рецензии, написанные ранее, получали самые негативные оценки, и я решил пересмотреть своё мнение, хотя бы потому, что я ошибался. Введение CZ75-Auto, боже, это ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ пистолет, введение предсказаний во время турниров, таких как DreamHack. Да, массовые стримы, орущий SL4M стал классикой, а Сеня продолжает радовать. Стримы с каэс стали интереснее, да и в целом, она поднялась, лично для меня с коленок.
Оговорюсь, до уровня CS 1 ей ещё далеко, но она близка к тому, чтобы стать ей конкурентом.

This game is also fun to play with friends on community servers to play common things like surf, mini games, or jailbreak.

The shot rings out, from the speakers of the telescreen. In that moment, the son contemplates his life's future. He sees a happy family playing by a white picket fence, his arm around his young wife's waist as they plant the ""SOLD"" sign on the front lawn. The daughter sees her prince charming, as they walk down the aisle together into an endless union of love.

730,unityid,9,10,2,False,35.6,June 5,"After more gamplay, about 24 hours, I can draw to a better conclusion.
This game is not a bad game- its actually good.
But it does have some flaws I dont like. Mostly with the community.
Pros
Doesnt require a high spec PC
Different modes
Different weapons for different teams (increases variety)
Spray patterns add challenge
Community maps and modes are all over the workshop, so theres alot of things to do.
Cons
Community is disrespectful, which completely ruins the game.
For example, if you had a bad rank, (Silver, Recruit, etc.) Theyll probably act like youre some sort of noob at the game and cant play it at all. 
Remember how the CoD Community was apparently so toxic during MW2 and BO2? Imagine that, but 3 times as bad.
Skins are WAY too important in this game. Skins and microtransactions should be something you do when youre bored, dont wanna buy a game, so you blow some money on random in game things. Not something that completely makes up the game itself. You cant go into a single round without seeing almost every gun spray painted like its a dress up game.
Ranking system is AIDS. Not the ranks themself, just that it probably would take you 8 months just to reach Recruit 2. You  probably rank up higher in the actual military than this game.
Last, the players will go out of there way to destroy and silence anyone who doesnt like their game. For example, look on the comments for this in a few weeks, itll become more cancerous than Chernobyl.
Im not saying all of them are like this- just a majority who think that just because you dislike their game, youre either a CoD fan, a troll, or bad at it. They never think ""Huh, maybe this guy has an actual reason to dislike it. To each their own.""
Final verdictIf you want a tactical shooter that requires you to think, work together, and use stealth, then go for it. Its got everything youd want, you can even hear footsteps, so thats another thing to control over. The amount of detail and features Valve put in is challenging, and keeps the game fresh.
But if you want a good community with respectable players, keep looking. Thats not here.			"

It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team.
 Skill ceiling is way lower than it was in CS 1.6 and shot hitreg is mostly random, even if you aim perfectly at the head, there is always a luck factor and you can always miss the shot, unless at extremely close ranges. Skill is not so important and instead favors using tons of smokes and nades to deplete time for Terrorists, and T´s cannot do much about it since nades and flashes are so weak in this version.
Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking.
On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, (altough pistols/shotguns are still overpowered and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay.
I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up.
This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.

730,djsoulfck,10,12,0,True,357.3,"May 13, 2015","tl;dr -> Tried this out, eventually opened a few boxes, got some knives and other $100+ gun skins, sold for profit, bought lots of other fun games. Thanks GabeN. 11/10 feeds my digital gambling itch.
My route to getting this game was interesting in that I was almost completely turned off what is currently (197.4h at the time of writing this review) my most played game. I initially had traded for this game and accumulated around 20ish hours of playtime, only to have my copy revoked. Fortunately, someone was nice enough to gift me this game a short time later.
If you like team-based multiplayer games, gambling by opening boxes, first-person shooters (FPS), gambling by opening boxes, the Counter-Strike series (1.6 was my baby), and gambling, then you will really enjoy this game. 
The aesthetics are very good - the amount of detail in the background, guns, and character models is well-done. The sounds and music are great and add to the intense atmosphere, but I eventually muted the music in favor of my own (usually Ariana Grande's soothing voice while I unleash hell on my enemies; except in competitive where I don't play music). You can even buy custom music packs if you are offered it randomly, however, I don't recommend doing this unless you have some extra cash (or really love a track); you can ""borrow"" anyone's custom music if you want to sample. It's nice that the gun sounds are distinct enough that you can identify what weapon is being fired with enough practice. 
The controls are easy to learn and typical of your standard first-person shooter. There is a very helpful tutorial you can play that shows you everything you need to know (complete with Valve's helpful popup tips). The learning curve is minimal to extreme depending on your experience with FPS games and how far up you intend to climb the competitive ladder (unless you wish to only play casual game modes). I was rusty as I had not been playing FPS games for years (last Counter-Strike title was 1.6, and last FPS was probably Black Ops 2 on the PS3), so I waited until I had 110ish hours of casual play before I felt good enough to play competitive. I haven't turned back since (although I sometimes dabble in casual game modes).
There are a variety of game modes like deathmatch, arms race (kills give you a different weapon, and you must eventually obtain a kill with a knife to win), and classic objective games (bomb plant/defusal and hostage rescue). In casual play, there will be a maximum of 10 players on each team, while in competitive play it is always a 5 vs. 5 format (people who are kicked/dropped will be replaced by a controllable bot). 
Gameplay can be fast-paced and intense, however, at many times (especially in competitive) it can be very slow and equally intense (if not more). Unlike games like Battlefield and Call of Duty, you cannot aim down the sights (ADS) with every weapon; instead, you can only ADS with a scoped battle rifle for either the Terrorist (T) or Counter-Terrorist (CT) side. There are three sniper rifles you can use with 2 levels of zoom. There is a pistol on the Terrorist side that can be switched to burst-fire, and a rifle on the Counter-Terrorist side that can be similarly switched. CT's also have a pistol and assault rifle that starts off with silencer (quieter, more accurate shots) that can be removed. There are a few weapons that can be switched out (ex: the M4A4 for CT's can be switched with the silenced M4A1-S). You can also switch default skins on guns with ones you have in your inventory. These skins can be obtained either through random drops as you play (given at the end of every game) or by opening boxes (this costs money unless you are a trader). You can also obtain skins from the steam marketplace (or even outside it), but I highly recommend you check resources like /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade on reddit to help you out.
In combat, you can crouch, but not go prone. You cannot climb/mantle over objects, however, you can ""boost"" in competitive game modes (where unit collision is allowed) by jumping onto a crouched player in order to reach a higher position. There is recoil in the game, and accurate range plays an important role in determining whether or not you will actually hit your opponent. Bullets can travel through material like doors and various types of cover for less damage. Wearing a helmet will block one shot to the head, however, and other subsequent headshots will result in an instant kill. 
Game matches consist of several rounds (15 in casual, 30 in competitive, best of), and at the beginning of each round you must purchase your equipment - consisting of your primary and secondary weapons, armor/defusal kit/hostage rescue kit, and grenades (smoke, flash, decoy, etc). You can hold one primary and one secondary weapon. If you die, you will start the next round with only the default starting pistol. If you live, you will refill ammo for whatever weapons you are holding. Money is used to buy all items, and money is given to all players depending on their performance (ex: winning side gets more money).
A critical element in this game is the lack of self-regeneration - what you have is what you have. Your health is only refilled when a new round begins, so playing smartly will aid you greatly. I do recommend playing competitive to help you understand the mechanics of the game better - there are generally a lot of nice people willing to help new players. 
Overall, the game is easily one of my favorite in the FPS genre (and this is being raised also as a Battlefield and Call of Duty child) and is even more amazing if you can manage to play with friends. If you are interested in multiplayer FPS gameplay at all, you definitely must check this out.
ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!
Cheers,

Just the other day a filthy plebian called me a ""n00bm"" but once I showed him how good I was in Counter-Strike, his call of duty filled mind just exploded, and he died. All of my friends like me because of how good I am in this game. Being good in this game is the meaning of my life.			"
730,brutalistu,10,12,0,True,"3,027.5","November 26, 2013","It's different than previous installments in the series. 
The recoil of the weapons is dramatic and infuriatingly unreal looking. It's very possible to almost completely miss a target standing in front of you at no more than 1 meter (gamewise meter) and deliver only one hit with the AK. The AWP for example isn't the surgical instrument of death no more. The shoot area isn't a dot (the dot in the center of your reticle) but a quite large ""box"".  
Also the physics of it seem a bit off, I cannot understand how you can be stopped from running from being hit with a smoke grenade, HE grenade, flash bang or molotov/incendiary. It is ridiculous and reminds me of the old stuck-in-the-ground with smoke launched at feet bug in Counter-Strike 1.4. 
I have the frustrating sensation that I am constantly playing a BETA game, a BETA I have purchased.  
Also lots of cheaters in Competitive matches. Competitive matches were supposed to be the bread and butter of the new series but the experience is very often destroyed by obvious cheat using players. I guess it is so easy to cheat in this game since there are lots of them. The Overwatch isn't helping much and participating in the Overwatch program ruins the faith in this program because 4 in 5 demos submited to Overwatch have players blatantly using wallhack. I guess the Overwatch can VAC ban one and while 10 more players start using it.
In spite of all it has potential, it looks good and the maps, the old ones and the new ones added, are interesting and fun to play.			"

----------------------------------------
Overall Game
----------------------------------------
CS:GO has a lot of gameplay options for players - community servers offering a variety of game modes, casual gaming ranging from defuse maps, hostage maps, deathmatch mode, and a fast-paced Arms Race mode where you aim to go through each weapon until you get a Golden Knife kill to win.  Beyond casual gaming, there is a competitive system that rank-matches you, similar to many other FPS games, and runs for up to 30 rounds of CS, after which your rank is affected one way or another.
Competitive play is both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding, although some players either take it far too seriously or treat it like casual unranked gaming.  It's hard to find a team that sits in the nice middle ground between the two.
If you've played a shooter game before, GO will be familiar.  WASD, crouching, walking (as opposed to running), and grenades.  It's relatively straightforward gameplay, only made hard by the skill of your opponents.
The game has a bit of a learning curve.  Each weapon acts differently and may take some time to learn which you like and which works best in certain situations.  After that, the grenades are the next thing to consider attempting to master.  They often can turn a losing game into a winning one.
The best way to learn is to play, so get in there and have fun. :D
Overall Rating: 9/10

Overall Accessibility
----------------------------------------
CS:GO is not very accessible for deaf gamers.
The game itself has no captions that I have been able to find, but the only thing that would need captioning is the weapons tutorial that you're likely to use once, if at all.
CS can consistently be a challenge to deaf gamers because of the significant impact of sound during play.  Many players OFTEN sit and wait for the enemy to come near, reacting to footsteps or grenades/weapon fire that cannot be seen, but can be easily heard.  One particular edge hearing gamers have over deaf gamers is guard the target area from a distance by listening for nearby enemies, only moving out of hiding when they need to.  A deaf gamer's need to see the target site to properly defend it puts them at greater risk of being killed.
Additionally, competitive mode gamers make heavy use of the microphone capability to communicate quickly.  There are text/voice binds in game (using the Z, X, and C keys) that can convey significant messages rather quickly and easily, but I find that most hearing gamers at mid-level skill are not receptive to either the voice binds or to text chat.
Deaf gamers in competitive gaming may encounter hostility or discrimination from hearing gamers.

This game was never meant to be a single player game or beginner friendly. Unfortunely it is a team based game, which means you either put in hard work, get better, work with your team and love it or you will fail, stagnate, curse your team and hate the game forever.

CS:GO has an horrible community, lots of cheaters, lots of smurfs, and a primitive hit detection.
-Most part of the community in this game is rude and cruel.
-There are lots of smurfs, which are basically players that buy new steam accounts with CS:GO just to play competitive gamemode against lower ranks. This will make you find players that play way better than you but they are on the same rank as you because they are using their smurf accounts.
-The Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) doesn't seem to work because you can find cheaters almost in every single game.
-The Hit Detection is pretty ridiculous. Sometimes you shoot to the enemy and it doesn't register, other times you shoot to the ground and you kill the enemy with an headshot. Some people call this recoil, but recoil moves your gun and not only the bullets like it happens in this game. When you spray in this game, if you aim to the ground, the bullets will go up but the gun will be aiming the ground like if the barrel was bent.
I would sum up this game with the following keywords: Cheaters, Smurfs, Rude community, Bad Hit Detection.
PS: I really like Counter-Strike, I play it since 1.6, but this is really sad because cheaters and smurfs are ruining the game!			"
730,hasziszijjun,18,27,0,True,"1,625.7","November 26, 2013","Counter-Strike is said to be the most popular tactical team-based first-person shooter with a timeless soul. The fourth full-fledged part of this game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, makes old school players feel at (renovated) home. The rules are known to all yet hardly anyone knows everything and it’s obvious that devil is in the details. You can play in several modes but classic competitive deserves attention primarily. Five terrorists against five counter-terrorists in two varieties: planting/defusing bomb or detention/release of hostages. The formula is simple but not simplistic.
It’s a pity that there are many players trying to cheat. Fortunately, some of them are consistently disqualified by Valve. The most beautiful thing in this game is visible growth and major obstacle may be the first steps and initial figuring out the system and players’ behavior... There are neither unusual skills nor fancy tricks. The tools are simple - a dozen guns and other weapons like grenades as well as your ideas and tactics, which you can share with others, that actually being a must. It is gratifying that this product is still being patched and from time to time new maps are created and there are real gems among them. Well, of course it’s a chance to meet a lot of great gamers with whom you can play other productions as well.
You must be prepared to be yelled at sometimes. You may hear you don’t know how to play, that you are f**king noob with no skill. One way or another, CS:GO teaches humility and cooperation. I've never been an avid fan of this series but this game is really addictive because I am able to feel that I play better with each match. The magic progress is oozing and there is no way to measure it numerically.			"

730,ReturnStaminaaa,18,27,2,False,"1,233.0",June 23,"Counter Strike Global Offensive .. oder sollte ich eher sagen ""Russian Offensive""? 
Naja , fangen wir mal an.
CSGO ist an sich ein gutes spiel für Teamplay , es hat aber auch seine schwächen.
Hier erstmal die Stärken wenn man als 5 man Team spielt: 
1. Gute Callouts. (Heißt positions angabe etc.)
2. Eine MAIN Sprache.
3. Keine Russen im team ,die einen anschreien.
4. Spaß
___________
Kommen wir zu den Schwächen :
1. immer Russen als gegner.
2. Viel Geflame 
3. Viel Hass.
Kommen wir zu dem spiel an sich :
Es ist gut! Keine frage.
Aber es gibt dennoch unzählige BUGS!
Bugs :
1. VAC Error.
Wenn man (so wie ich) einen VAC error bekommen in einem Matchmaking und sowas vorher noch nie hatte , ist man verwirrt und weiß nicht was man machen soll. Also habe ich meinen PC restartet und hatte promt nen 7en Tage ban , wegen NICHTS.
2 .VAC SYSTEM 
Das VAC system ist schlechter und verbuggter als alles andere in dem spiel.
(*)Man Kann ganz easy mit einem Hack (der nicht detectet ist) durchrennen für 2 spiele ,macht dann 25 std pause und rennt wieder durch.
3.
OVERWATCH 
Die Demos im Overwatch sind verbugger als jede demo die es gibt.
First of all : 
Es sind nur 30 Tick Demos. ( What is tick? : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVmqv3z4gnA )
Second of all : Man kann einen overwatch ban ganz einfach umgehen. (Siehe *)
Kommen wir zu den Waffen.
Das waffenupdate ist scheiße
Wenn man low ammo hat (die letzten 6-5 schuss) Knackt die waffe bei jedem schuss. (Warum auch immer das nützlich ist)
REVOLVER : ERSTER TAG OP WIE SONST WAS!!! zweiter tag low und scheiße
MAG7 : Früher shotgun , Heute : Blechbüchse 
Negev : Früher eine CSGO Waffe , heute ein BF3 MG
M249 : Früher ein CSGO Mg , Heute ein CSGO Mg Mit realistischem sound.
Kommen wir zu Prime :
Prime ist meiner meinung nach unnötig.
Es soll vor cheaten und smurfern shützen...
Es cheaten trotzdem leute rein und bekommen nen OW Ban ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIaaO1VJW9Y )
"" hab nicht gehackt, hatte ein 760€ inventar. Hatte nen 2. acc mit dem ich geraged hackt habe und die telefon nummer war auch mit meinen main verknüpft deswegen﻿"" -Shxrkz
Smurfer? 
Jedes match 3.
Prime ist und bleibt sinnlos.
Kommen wir nun zu den Skins..
Es gibt leute die haben ein 13337€ (oder höher) inventar und geben dafür immer mehr geld aus.
Skins sind nicht pflicht!
Skins sehen gut aus (die meisten) aber kosten auch sehr viel.
Also wer csgo mit skins spielen will (Vernünfitges loadout) muss mit minimum 600€ rechnen.
CS:GO ist ein teurer marketplace für skins.
______________________________
Kommen wir zu Matchmaking :
Es gibt zu 30% nur russen ,20% deutsche cheater 30% toxic dudes die einen nur zu flamen ( russen) , 5% Smurfs , 5% Griefer , 10% normale spieler.
Kommen wir zu den MM Cooldowns :
""How long will my competitive cooldown last?
Competitive cooldowns in CS:GO have four levels. When an account receives a competitive cooldown, the cooldown level remains on the account for a one-week probationary period. Any additional cooldowns received during the one-week probationary period increases the amount of time players are restricted from matchmaking:
First cooldown (level 1) - lasts 30 minutes
Second cooldown (level 2) - lasts 2 hours
Third cooldown (level 3) - lasts 24 hours
Fourth cooldown (level 4) - lasts 1 week""
........
""How do I determine my current cooldown level?
Your current cooldown level can be determined by the length of the last cooldown you have received:
My last cooldown lasted 30 minutes - you are currently at level 1
My last cooldown lasted 2 hours - you are currently at level 2
My last cooldown lasted 24 hours - you are currently at level 3
My last cooldown lasted one week - you are currently at level 4 (or above)""
Wenn man dank steam nen VAC Error bekommt und ihn nicht innerhalb von 5 min FIXT , bekommt man nen ban. In meinem fall 7Days.
Valve sollte meiner meinung nach sich auf die Cooldowns und Fixes konzentrieren ,und nicht auf Skins , Kisten , Geld.
Für mich ist valve einfach nur geldgeil.
Kommen wir zum rankystem :
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312582297
Da man eh nurnoch hackern und smurfern begegnet , lohnt es sich nicht weiter das zu erklären.
_________________________________
Fazit :
csgo lohnt sich für leute die noch 4 freunde haben die csgo auch noch spielen.
man sollte immer als 5man spielen und mindestens 3 sollten das spiel verstanden haben.
man sollte so wenig wie möglich spielen ,da man am ende flie­ßend russisch kann.
Wer aber auf gebannt werden aus ist , und eins der verbuggtesten spiele 2015/16 spielen will , ist bei csgo ganz richtig.
15€ fürn verbuggtes und verhacktes spiel lohnen sich nicht , da kauft man lieber über keyshops, oder lässt es sofort sein......			"

Unlike step 1 and 2 games the CS:GO items are worth alot more. Keep in mind however they do not have any perks like the TF2 weapons so when you get a new weapon you don't even need to test it out so it saves you time.
Playing randomly will drop item boxes that you need keys to unlock. The keys are often worth alot more than the box. These keys are very important in trading. If you have 5-10 of those keys then you can trade them for games.  The weapons themselves can be sold on the market. You could always get 10 of the same box and get keys for all of them and open. You will most likely get the least worth items in the boxes however so be careful.
If you get rare weapons then never equip them ingame. People will then think that you like the game or are a pro player and they will spam invite you to join their game sessions. Some players even get angry depending on what skin you have on your weapon when you kill them. If the skin is really rare they will get angry. But if you have a common skin they will get really angry and if you have the regular skin they will ragequit and comment on your profile.
Surfing in CS:GO is however fine. Its good to trade on surfing servers. All pro traders can trade and surf at the same time. There are many servers that uses plugins that almost makes CS:GO feel like CS:S again and is totally worth checking out. Unlike the normal gamemodes people in the few custom gamemodes that still exist are pretty friendly and they usually have active admins to deal with the many troublemakers that roam freely in the normal gamemodes.

730,Jpocalypse,12,16,0,False,797.4,"September 24, 2014","This game was the best tactical game I had ever played. The community was good, people were mature, sportsmanship was very well presented.
But all of that changed when the skins came. The community of Counter Strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant. This community is turning into TF2 but instead of hats it is skins. It's a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items. Really valve? You are turning this game into TF2 and it's a joke. More immature underage children are playing this game now and I don't like and I am certain that I am not the only one who thinks this way.
First off, the community now is a disgrace. You could be playing with someone, become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to ""borrow"". BAM! Skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing. It increases the scamming within this steam community.
Second, the competitive mode is great. It is challenging and very teamwork based, but all that can change with a steam sale. Hackers banned? Well then let's price Counter Strike: Global Offensive to £3.50. Oh boy that was a good idea right? A steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well. People also buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive on a different account, so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose. It's a complete and utter disaster when it happens. It needs to end.
Thirdly, Cases are ridiculous. You literally have a 0.01% chance to get a ""Rare special item"" (Knife). People waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day it's a ""Virtual Item"". You could go out and buy a real knife for about £50 at highest while the highest in this game is about £600. The economy is terrible. Community is terrible. Skins are a joke and Steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases.
Fourthly and lastly is the, ""Hit Detection"". This game has a pretty bad hit detection system. Valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope! they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful. I mean Valve, Come on! You make millions of £ and $, why can't you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in? 
This game is great once you get into it and ""IF"" you find a decent server (124 tick) it is pretty fun. One other thing I forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you ""leave"", ""Kill a teammate"", ""Kick too many players"" or even if your power cuts during a match, you only have ""3 minutes"" to return to the match. Abandon the match? Ok sir we give you a 7 day ban. A ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days. It is a bit unfair the banning system. It is automatic so it cannot be revoked. Please Valve, fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself.

However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming.

Hackers and smurfs run rampant which ruins a lot of the playability. Sometimes it can however cause people to want to improve their own skills, but I find that a lot of the time people lose the will to play when they face either of these.
One thing that bothers me most of all is the ranking system. The way it is now is based on wins more than anything, which doesnt exactly value your own skill level, since winning a match is more of a team effort than solo plays. 
If Valve were to change the ranking system to be based off of a persons individual skills, based on accuracy, kills, deaths, points, assists, etc. Then it would give you a better idea of that persons skill level, and putting that person with others of their skill level for a match would produce a lot better results than the current system. It would also discourage smurfs and hackers as well, since their stats would affect the ranks and the players they are put with.
I cant recommend this game because of the lack of effort that is put into weeding out hackers and smurfs. The community run overwatch helps a great deal, but its not preventing the hacking in the first place, and it wont change the ranks people lose when faced against these kinds of people.
Update: 05/08/2015
A lot of the times the matchmaking system can make mistakes. But some things you just cant avoid. I find that a lot of people that play CSGO dont understand the fact that this is a team game. Today we played a competitive, the other team had at least one hacker, and our team had 2 people griefing. They were throwing the bomb away, flashbanging us on purpose, standing in our line of sight, just because they wanted to lose the match. They wanted to derank themselves. Which is another problem that comes with smurf accounts. Once they get a rank they need to lower it, so they lose games on purpose, bringing the whole team down with them.			"

It is a well-priced shooter for the countless hours you are probably going to spend playing it. My only complaint would be the importance players think skins have (yes, they are beautiful, but they are damn useless), problem that spawns a new species of player: the one who bought Cs:GO only to open cases and brag to his friends about what skins he got,literally not even playing the game, only marketing skins.

730,-Kubix,15,22,2,False,"2,465.8","October 15, 2014","I've wasted a lot of time in this game. I think, I finally can say my own opinion. 
 
 First of all, this game doesn't have an optimisation. Even though, you have a very powerful computer, it still will be lagging as ♥♥♥♥ as it's possible. Secondly, VAC Anti-cheat doesn't work properly. There are many cheaters and what's very important, Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥! In addition, the rank system in this game is totally unfair. You can be de-ranked for no reason. Also, there can be some people who have very low rank but they still can play like the global elite players( I don't mean about people who have the second account with low rank). Furthermore, the real community of this game consists of the ♥♥♥♥ing idiots who cannot play well and they can only complain for some ♥♥♥♥. As well as, annoying and pulling whole team down can be made by them. Unfortunately, it's really hard to find someone who can play well and without any doubt, show the real meaning of teamplay.
 
 By the way, about those things like the skins or something like this that don't make any sense. Valve is trying to get some money in the different ways. Especially, it's associated to the ♥♥♥♥ing crates and keys. I completely don't recommend you to buy them, you'll actually lose money. 
 
 In conclusion, this game definitely sucks and it can lead you to get a brain cancer. What's really funny that I will never stop playing this ♥♥♥♥. Probably, I am already addicted.
 
 Here is a small advice for Valve: Valve, you are supposed to do something useful for this game that can really improve it.			"

After CS:S was released, I was very content with the way the series had been progressing. The updated gameplay and graphics gave me a boosted interest in a game I had not played in several years. 
When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released, I was not feeling the same way. The frantic and well edited trailers made the game look spectacular, that is until I noticed it was still running on the source engine, albeit a modified version. Given the hefty price tag, I stayed away from CS:GO for as long as possible, until I noticed how many updates had been made since the first CS:GO beta, and the subsequent gold release. It was obvious, the developer planned on putting as much effort into maintaining the game as they were to keep the game fresh and even competitive. 
Once I finally bought the game on sale for a decent price, I realized what I had been missing. Competitive mode has changed the way the game feels and works. It was very easy to get bored playing CS:S, because as the popularity increased, so did the servers. Pretty soon you were competing against 32 players on the opposing team, making for a hellish free-for-all, despite the team based combat. CS:GO found the perfect solution by introducing a competitive game mode. Instead of having to play with your friends in 5v5 tournaments, CS:GO incorporated a 5v5 mode that mirrored the professional experience, making it a lot more fun to play. The fine-tuned competitive mode, coupled with officially supporting death match and the arsenal game modes, making CS:GO a game with a lot more re-playability, and a lot more fun.
Some people are critical about the inclusion of skins, turning CS:GO into Team Fortress 2, but they fail to recognize the importance of customization. The skins don't really impact the gameplay, and are not overly obnoxious like some of the content included in TF2. In addition to the developer created content, the inclusion of community created weapon skins and operations allow community members to profit while increasing the awareness and fun of the game. I am not a fan of DLC, especially since most DLC is lack-luster overpriced content that should have normally been included in the game at launch, but was separated out to pay-for downloadable content in the interest of pumping out sequels and printing money instead of focusing on quality. CS:GO however, chooses community content to include, and gives back to the authors who continue to breath life into the game.
Overall, I was skeptical when it was first released, but the developer's constant attention to detail and genuine intention to keep the game balanced and competitive has made this the best game in the series. I highly recommend fans of the series update to CS:GO and enjoy themselves.			"
730,Tibi2001,7,7,0,True,"1,278.1","August 25, 2013","The latest installment in Valve's Counter-Strike series brings us great, addicting gameplay, a colourful, alive world in a game that combines great mechanics, with great performance. It is my second most played game, soon to become the first. The item drop system is similar to the one in Team Fortress 2. At the end of a match you may or may not receive an item. A skin, a weapon case, you never know ! 
   The best way to play, is to play competitively. The game has a Matchmaking system, that finds you a nearby server to play on, with 9 other players to fill your 5v5 match. This is where you have to play good, where you have to win.
   After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your  K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches. The Matchmaking system's job is to match you with players of your level. If you don't wanna play serious, though, you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff! Deathrun, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, you name it! It's still tons of fun. But the real deal is in Competitive.

First of all , you need some skills to play this game correctly , and when you get enough skills , you'll get more fun and more fun! 
Second , if you play this game with your friends , you'll get into it faster than playing SOLO , so its more fun with your friends instead of playing with randoms , then u'll try to be more better especially if you find a decent mates-team that plays with you , you'll start looking for some strats , then you'll play it more like serious.
Third , for graphics , i dont really care about any game's graphics when its fun , but CS:GO's graphics are decent so there is no reason to complain about it.
4th , its gameplay , that every COD player complains about it. especially 'recoil' its really hard to control it but that's the the game you need to practice with your recoil , and try to find out the best settings you can play with.
And there is alot of good things about this amazing game but sadly i cannot write them all in one review .
And there is some bad things about this game , like after every update some people start getting some weird lags , i think they need to fix it , and if you're looking to play this game more serious , dont play on MatchMaking servers , because its full of R_E_T_A_R_D_S and alot of trolls and its a land of AFKs , thats just made me feel mad , just go on esea , esl , leetway and so on , and one more thing , and its after about every steam sale , CS:GO become a land of cheaters , and thats just redicouless.

730,jedrik,7,7,0,True,"2,483.4","June 21, 2013","TL;DR: STFU AND PLAY!
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is designed to be competitive and only competitive. If being competitive is your kind of fun, then this is definitely the game for you!
Take note that if you have a high competitive rank, do not use matchmaking during or after Steam sales! You will be queued against blatant hackers who will just pull your rank down. Valve's method to address this issue is by limiting the wins of unranked players to 2 per day. This is supposed to make boosting services more expensive, but if your mom has the $$$ then it won't stop you from being a dumbass GE.
As for lower ranked players, the only thing you should worry about when the game goes on sale are smurf accounts. Since the game was designed to heavily punish players for abandoning a match and to limit the range of skill groups, many players have resulted to purchase more copies of the game -- possibly a copy for each day of the week and for each range of skill groups. This is a flawed system created by Valve, and I doubt it will ever be fixed. Clearly, Valve just wants to sell hats -- or in this case, stickers.
In my opinion, competitive cooldowns are stupid. Competitive cooldowns a.k.a. temporary bans are given to players who abandon a match. This is good for promoting competitive play and all, but the current implementation for detecting an intentional abandon is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (ret4rded -- good job flagging this word, ♥♥♥♥♥♥). If you have random connection issues for a mere 5-10 minutes -- possibly due to terrible Internet Service Providers, this will immediately be considered an abandon, and you will not be allowed to help the four teammates you are clearly in a party with. If you are live streaming on Twitch.tv and get DoS attacked by one of your viewers, you will most definitely be given a 7 day cooldown every single time you live stream. If your game crashes in the middle of a match due to VPK errors and are forced to verify the integrity of your game cache, or if Windows Update decides it would be a good time to install updates and restart your computer... /gg.
Whoever thought it would be a good idea to give a cooldown to a player who team-kills a bot in order to prevent it from giving away free guns and knife-kill rewards to the enemy? Please, for the love of GO, CS-GO KILL YOURSELF!!!
CS:GO bots, just like in DotA2, are incredibly stupid no matter what difficulty you set them to. They rarely follow commands and will most likely give the bomb as well as their gun to the Counter-Terrorists. Bomber bots has been ""addressed"" in a previous update by allowing players to take the bomb from bots. The A.I. remains the same -- stupid and unresponsive.
Overwatch is unreliable. Overwatch allows low ranked idiots with zero map awareness to be the judge whether a Global Elite is cheating or not. Valve's idea of being qualified and experienced enough to become an Overwatch investigator is based on numeric variables of your CS:GO activity. Basically, all you need are 150 competitive matchmaking wins, a decent rank (not Silver), 500 hours of your game idling in the background while you watch anime, and an account with low report counts (a.k.a. nobody reported you for being better than them at the game). If low report counts were to be the only qualification to be an investigator, then eventually, everyone skilled enough would have been reported by some newbie. Does this mean the newbies will be the only ones left qualified for Overwatch since higher ranked players were reported by idiots? Only time will tell...
Overwatch is in a way pretty useful for detecting blatant all-out cheaters but extremely inadequate for spotting casual cheaters with minimal settings and who are very good at portraying Romeo and Juliet. This is because Overwatch only shows the investigator out-of-sync portions of the actual demo based on events triggered by the suspect. This makes it seem as though every suspect is using an aimbot especially with the low tickrate being used on the official matchmaking demos. Yet another waste of a very capable idea, Valve.
On the bright side, competitive hostage rescue actually works really well compared to older versions of Counter-Strike. Carrying the hostage, instead of having the incredibly intelligent A.I. of every Valve game ever developed follow you with blindfolds on, makes the gameplay a lot more credible.
For those of you who prefer playing casually, you are better off playing Counter-Strike: Source. I find CS:Source more casually fun due to smooth movement especially for kz, bhop, surf, and trikz style game modes. Sadly, the CS:Source community is now officially dead.
It would be common for people to assume CS:GO being the cause of the dead CS communities; however, this is not the case. People get bored eventually, so they end up looking for something different to try out: a new game, a different genre, or even a different lifestyle. The only thing CS:GO did to these older communities is to possibly hold on to what is left of them by allowing them to merge as one. If Valve/Hidden Path were to introduce a matchmaking system in CS:Source and maybe even in CS 1.6, I am sure a lot of players would pick their preference.
Clean bunny-hopping is possible on CS:GO if and only if you use hacks or server-side plugins with sv_enablebunnyhopping. Therefore, this may not be a game for all you BHop pros. Surf and air-acceleration still work though; however, it is not as smooth compared to CS:Source surfing especially on 64-tickrate servers. Not to mention, the game randomly stutters so much that it is impossible to do anything with precision and accuracy -- memory leaks?
With the default value of sv_airaccelerate increased from 10 to 12, this makes it a lot easier to reach those certain jump spots that everyone enjoys doing. Good job, Valve! Now please increase the damn matchmaking tickrate or at least give us an option to choose!

730,JoshYee,7,7,0,True,"3,157.6","May 2, 2014","CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.
In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.
The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.
Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

Fascinating Horse Facts:
1) Horses can sleep both lying down and standing up.
2) Horses can run shortly after birth.
3) Horses have been domesticated for over 5000 years.
4) Horses are one of the more intelligent mammals, able to program actual video games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. While generally good, there is some immersion breaking present in the game. For example, when coding ""realistic human footsteps,"" the devs just recorded the footsteps themselves, which is why your human avatar's footsteps sounds like a horse stampeding. I think the devs should have consulted some actual humans on how things actually work before changing the game.
5) Horses have bigger eyes than any other mammal that lives on land.
6) Horses have around 205 bones in their skeleton. Spooky!
New Comp Meta:
1) As a CT, if you hear footsteps, the T's are at the other site.
2) If you hear horses galloping, the T's are somewhere between the two sites.

There was a time a few months ago when I probably would have recommended this game, where it was a competitive yet enjoyable game. But the last few updates have really changed my mind about this game, valve have pushed and pushed and now they have finally gone and ruined this game.
It started a month or so ago where the m4-s was nerfed to a level of practically becoming unplayable. Now as someone who used the m4-s over the a4 it took some time to get used to switching to the m4, to actually be on a relatively even balance with the ak. I would say that the m4-s might be a bit to overpowered to have the damage and accuracy at range that it did have, but what they did was pure overkill, where the m4-s is now practically unviable in nearly all situations.
And then came yesterday's update, which has completely ♥♥♥♥ed up the game. Yeah it shortened the bomb and round timers which I like, as well as the ability to call a time out, but everything else this update brought in has completely broken it. 
First of all the rifles were hit with a nerf where spraying at long ranges is now insanely innacurate. When you spend time practicing the spray patern of a gun over and over it's pretty annoying to know that all that time spent has pretty much gone to waste. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off enough having to learn the m4a4 pattern after the s nerf, but now the a4 and ak are useless at range. Yeah this encourages tapping/bursting but guess what? They also ♥♥♥♥ed that too. The gamne has always been riddled with hit reg issues but instead of sorting it they are now making it worse because basically your first shot which is supposed to be the most accurate actually lands above the centre of your crosshair, so tapping is just as useless as spraying.
Then they brought in the r8 revolver. As if there wasn't enough problems already, why not add a pistol that costs $850 and can kill in on shot if you aim ABOVE THE WAIST. Great idea, now every gun is practically obsolete, as this gun carries the power of a shotgun at the range of the AWP. Eco rounds no longer exist as this gun can rip through any opponent, armoured or not. On top of all this the gun has near enough 100% accuracy whilst moving and jumping, you can spray it like a standard pistol with right mouse, oh and you can shoot it whilst defusing. This gun has broken the game.
But do valve care? Of course they don't. Of course with this new update came a new case, and a new case means more $$$ for valve so they're happy there. As long as people keep buying skins and keys they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ what anyone thinks about this broken game. They will probably never read this, even if they did they wouldn't care, because I am just 1 person complaining. But here is the best bit. Even if everyone stood by me, they still wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥. To them we are just a source of income, the people they care about, is the very small percentage of players, the handful of pros. As long as they are happy valve couldnt care less about the rest of us. Of course if pros weren't happy, events wouldnt happen. And if events don't happen who misses out? That's right, the penny pinchers that are valve. 
The only way they can sort this out is by removing the latest update completely from the game, they rifle nerf was un-needed, as was the addidtion of that stupid ♥♥♥♥ing gun. All I can say is good job vavlve, you have completely ruined your game, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of an unbelievably large amount of the people who play it, well done.

The base price of this game is so low because Valve decided to go the microtransaction-route (skins) and they make millions upon millions of dollars/euros on this - yet they still have cheap servers that rarely work well, and when they do, they are 64 tick which is - compared to 128 tick - massively worse.
To add to the negatives, there are so many russians and non-competitive people playing matchmaking that forces you to rank down, despite you carrying them. All this gets worse as you can't filter out russians, people with no mic and a specific rank (you can be global and play with silvers). Rather than investing in proper development for this game, they release new skins and knives as well as worthless updates to the game (new animations and spiderman-defuse textures).
Sorry, but this game is in its current state very bad and the fact that they give you 30 minutes of a competitive cooldown for being the worst of the worst.. or kicking these trolls (yes, you get a cooldown for kicking too many people) is absolutely disgusting.

Competitive is crowded with smurfs, poisonous jerks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who find it amusing to ruin their team's match on purpose, cheaters and kids. To be fair, kids are probably the most pleasant group to play with cause they mostly try to play well, even if they can't. If you play really, really well - you may be able to ignore the first 2 groups. The rest will still be there.
My biggest complaint towards competitive gameplay is that reporting people doesn't do much, especially reporting for offensive voice / text chat - it's always been merely a placebo button. Global Offensive jokes aside, you cannot imagine how fed up I am with people losing their ♥♥♥♥ when I say I am Russian, even if I carry the game and never insult anyone or talk about politics. I'm not going to lie about my nationality to play with a bunch of ignorant frustrated teenagers. What’s funniest – all of that mostly comes from other Europoors who everyone else would confuse with Russians anyway.

730,76561198064168484,7,7,0,False,82.1,January 30,"CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.
Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.
Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.
The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. 
This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. 
Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. 
And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.
You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.

Even though the movement and max sharpness of the mechanics has been dulled down QUITE a bit. I used to play CS:S just for target practice when idling for random reasons myself early 2013, but this game is complete enough to drag me into it. (4K h's by now) Even though again, i find there to be a lack of optimization considering how the game ran better in 2013/2014 (early), than today. 300+ fps VS today's 200-250FPS for reference.
The good old killing spree MOD from 1.6 Where you can spawn many times, which was about getting the most kills against the enemy team as a team, (A clusterfu*k without reason) and the classic zombie modes that has seen a return + a ton of other older mods from the past was/is missing though. With some returning slowly but surely however, GO is looking to become the best FPS game purchasable to this very date.
Thus, i recommend this game. Something i rarely do with anything. But even more so when you can get it 50% off when steam got sales!
By the way, you can get all your money and more back if you sell the stuff that drops in the game on the steam market. Which include sellings EVERYTHING. Or you can waste your money on another terrible gamble that will nver pay off because you got that extra money laying around from cases you sold in CS:GO, since when they drop related to events people pay super much for them and stuff...
10/10 (My old rating was 9/10) since you can eventually get your money back selling in-game items you get for free, stuff you can pay for is pushed frequently, spicing up the game if you wanna waste some money on skins, while the rest of the game is top notch compared to today's modern sub-par competition out there. The game is brutal and made for SKILLED play though, so go figure it is in general better made VS games like for example black ops 3.

Starting as a popular Half-Life mod, over the course of 15 years we now have Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also known as CSGO. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, 5vs5 team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site from Counter-Terrorists defusing whilst the timer counts down. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.   This is a hardcore skill based first person shooter. As this game if permanent death until next game it forces players to change their play style and adapt cautiously to succeed.
â€œDeath is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better."

730,jovik,7,7,2,True,"3,257.6",June 27,"I recommend this game if:
1. You play for statistics, having skins with ST tech, playing MM and only MM for amount of wins. 
2. You play to collect pins, skins, souvenirs, commendations.
3. You wait for the next big Majorman to competite in Pick'Em and 'reck all of your friends on the top of Leaderboard, if you wait for the next Operation coin out.
4. You want to learn English language, popular and overpopular phrases. To hear how bad are you at something... to know where you and your friends are from.
5. You want to have more games into your Steam account.
This game is not deserved to be at where it is now, who still has something like brain will agree - CS:S is the best CS and multiplayer game at all.
However have fun.
Don't bother to donate with hope to satisfy yourself by having another knife, it's just a model with a texture on it at a higher price than the game itself. Worth it?

People say its better than COD but that can only be a statement for people who play both games competitivly. If your looking for fun casual/comp game then COD is their but if your looking for a very very competitvly game with minor fun this game is for you. Also the amount of support this game gets is ♥♥♥♥ compared to how much money they take out of people who open cases. They never make a new map only remake ones to make it better which will take more than 10 months to ♥♥♥♥ing make and then once the new map is released it will still be unplayable.

falls Sie sich überlegen dieses Spiel käuflich zu erwerben, möchte ich die Person sein die Ihnen davon abrät.
Während ich einige Stunden damit verbracht habe mich diesem Limbus vergleichbarem Spiel hinzugeben, ist meine Wenigkeit zu dem Entschluss gekommen, das CS:GO nicht nur gesundheitsgefährdend ist sondern auch ein dünnes kurz vor dem reißendem Drahtseil, symbolisch für meine Psyche.
Wer nicht interessiert daran ist russische Beleidigungen oder der kompletten russischen Sprache mächtig zu sein, sollte die Finger von dem Titel lassen.
Doch nicht nur der komplette Kulturschock, dem man sich hingibt, beim Starten des Spiels ist ein negativer Faktor, sondern auch die parasitären Nebenexistenzen die das ganze ohne hin schon Nervenzereissende Abenteuer abrunden.
Das Highlight jedoch ist, dass man in dem von Steam bereitgestellten Store sich käuflich virtuelle Kisten wie auch Schlüssel die Virtuell sind erwerben kann.
Als ahnungsloser fragen sie sich wahrscheinlich gerade was diese bringen ?

-Easy to find an online match
-if you are from Europe,then you will master Russian language after playing this game
-Many community servers options
-A wonderful Esports Scene
Cons
-This game is like cocaine,You will get addicted very soon(not even kidding)
-if you play solo,Then you will get morons 99.9999% of the time
-you will find People who Thinks csgo rank is more important than Life
-This game is filled with cheaters(unplayable at high ranks),Trollers(At low ranks),Smurfs(At average ranks,you will see atleast 1 per game)
-Unbalanced Maps(Ex: Nuke)
-Unbalanced Pistols ( At close range/Medium range A 3100$ Rifle headshot does 89 damage,But a 500$ pistol does insta death)
-if you are a kid/ morons You will use your moms credit card to buy skins or for gambling
-Valve doesnt give a fc uk about this game,There are still the same bugs even after 4 years(ex: Valve DM).They take ages to fix even small bugs
-No Fun modes,This is a Really Really Really serious game
-No unranked matchmaking
-Valve Releases updates to Reduce your game fps instead of reducing bugs
-Prime matchmaking 
-Toxic community
What is prime matchmaking
you need to level 21(takes atleast a month if you play daily)and must have steam guards(To link your mobile with csgo account) to play prime matchmaking
Prime matchmaking guys will partner/face prime matchmaking guys(so this reduces cheaters/smurfs)
So new players have to play with cheaters/smurfs/morons untill they reach level 21 which is BS
Conclusion:This game is very addictive so Buy this only if you can control yourself during exams stuff and Play this game with friends only,Add Good Guys after the match so you can have a bunch of friends to play with
Bonus Tip: Dont do case openings(You will get BS skin 95%) and dont buy skins with real money(dont be stupid)			"

730,76561197993446754,8,9,0,True,"1,069.6","July 19, 2014","Ah Counter-Strike. What a wild mistress you are. At times you are loving and caring, offering great joy and hope. Then other times you are mad at me for reasons I do not understand and you cast me out; alone and unloved. 
First off, let me quickly say that the game mechanics are great. Every gun handles differently and you have to learn each one. It takes skill and practice and makes the game so much more rewarding. As a side note however, it's a bit irritating when you can only see a guys head (i.e, the gun is hidden behind a wall or something) and they can still shoot you. But I digress!
So in this game you have a few different modes that you can play, and each one has a very different play style. For instance, in Arms Race, there is no time to be subtle. You need to get 27 kills before the next guy, and you have to do this with every weapon in the game. As soon as you kill someone, your weapon switches out. This can be annoying if you're fighting several people at once, but the game is so fast paced that it really doesn't matter if you die. Instantly respawn and rush back into the field. The speed of this game makes it great for some community banter. You play in a team, but as you are really only playing for yourself, it doesn't matter if your team are doing well or not. I'll come back to this point about teams later.
Team Deathmatch is a fairly standard affair if you are familiar with any other FPS game. People spawn in and you have to kill them before they kill you. Simples! As this game mode is slower than Arms Race, you can afford to be a bit more patient. There is a timer instead of a ""reach this many points/kills."" Also, every now and then a bonus weapon appears, in which you'll get more points if you kill people with that. Respawn with this weapon and kill people within the time limit and you'll bag yourself some extra points. Person with the most points at the end wins. Again, this is a mostly light hearted game mode, and the community really shines through.
Next up is Demolition, my least favourite mode. It is much the same as the casual/competitive maps in which you have to try and plant a bomb, but the maps are smaller. The main difference in this game mode is you don't get to choose your gun. You start with a weapon and then when you kill someone in a round you change weapon at the start of the next round. Kill several people and you will be awarded with some grenades as well. The reason I dislike this mode is people can get out of sync with the weapons. If you do really well for several rounds, likelihood is you will now be on a weaker gun, or a gun you cannot personally use well. While it's good to get practice in, the realisation is that the other team can simply be on better weapons, leaving you at a major disadvantage. Again, after a few rounds they may be on a gun that they can't use and it levels the playing field again, but those few rounds can really be an irritant. 
 Now we are onto the meat and two veg. The bit the mistress both loves and despises. Competitive. In my time playing CS I have went from an absolutely horrendous player, having never really played many FPS's, to a fairly competent player. Over the space of a few months I went from unranked up to Master Guardian 1. I felt very proud of myself. However, the journey was not plain sailing. When entering a competitive mode, if you are not searching with friends, you can end up with wildly different experiences. This is where the community behind CS can really fall apart.
In a match with strangers you can have a great match with excellent communication (which is really needed in competitive) or have really bad communication and a lot of name calling. If you make a mistake, sometimes you will be supported with a lot of ""Unlucky, we'll get them next time!"" or you will receive something along the lines of ""OMG, YOU SUCK, NOOB, FFS, UNINSTALL."" This is particularly true if you're the last one left alive and all eyes are watching you. This isn't just from your team however. I have had games where I have had great communication with the opposition, and everything has been really friendly, but well fought. Othertimes however, they are raging across the keyboard at you. Yes, you can mute players, and often you may have to mute the opposition, but it is quite another to mute your team. As I said, communication is really important in a competitive match. Even if they are only yelling obscenities at you, they may occasionally have insight into where a player is. A main problem for this is it doesn't even matter if you are winning or losing. Your team could just be massively unhelpful. 
I have had a lot of fun playing competitive matches, however as time goes on it is becoming less and less fun. This could be because of all the steam sales, with people buying the game and jumping on just to be irritating. Maybe they had been banned previously and have made new accounts or some such thing. It just doesn't make for pleasant gaming however. I don't play games to become annoyed and irritated. I play them as a release. There is nothing more satisfying than doing something well. I remember playing a game on inferno as the terrorist and I had went up B. I was to push up and give them a fright while my team was to go up A. As I went up Banana, two guys came down to me. I headshotted them both. It was then that my team were shouting down the headsets. They had lost the bomb at top of middle. Only one team member had survived. He went to try and get the bomb and was instantly killed. I was on my own with 3 opponents left. I turned back round at banana and went up middle. Two were coming towards me and I take them out. Sadly, I was down to 12 health now, and the clock was ticking. I knew that the last guy was up on the left at top of middle. So I went through appartments silently. As luck would have it, a team mate of mine had a smoke grenade that had dropped there. I threw the smoke into top of middle and as it burst out I went for the bomb, with 30 seconds left to plant. The final enemy started spraying into the smoke and I knew where he was. I shot once and killed him, acing the round (or kill every enemey yourself). I've had aces before, but that one was special. My teammates errupted with cheers, as that was a very important round for us. Had we lost we would have had to eco (which is to not buy so you can save some money). It was those cheers and the great support that my team gave me that makes me love this game. The community can be incredible.
A quick note about casual is that it is pretty much identical to competitive, except with more players and thus less strategy and communication. Instead of only talking to your team, you are often talking to everyone in the game. The same issues with the community stand however. Sometimes they do a ""clutch or kick"" where the last surviving member of a team has to kill all the surviving members of the other team and win the round. This can be damn near impossible if your team didn't manage to do anything. This is often said when it's 5v1 or over. Often the community doesn't really kick the person, but I have seen it happen. I have also seen someone clutch a 6v1 and then got kicked regardless. So it's a bit of a hit and miss.
Overall, I would highly recommend this game. The mechanics are solid and the community as a whole is really great. The support people give is wonderful. Often there is great banter to be had in the non-ranked matches. Sometimes banter can come into the ranked matches, but more and more of late it has just been abuse. If you want to try your hand at competitive you will need a thick skin.			"
730,hexeract1g,8,9,0,True,"1,609.7","July 4, 2015","I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.
There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.
Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.
Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team. I stopped playing mm for this reason now mostly 10mans and faceit.			"

Counter Strike: Global Offensive cases can be magnificent, yet devastating at the same time. I write this review in the hopes that new players are alerted to the dangers of opening these Cases. Make no mistake, they are the best things in the world, yet will leave you hopeless, miserable and cheerless at the same time. They are the best friend you will ever have, you will have great times together, and you will go through rough times, believe me.  I must warn you one last time newcomer, these cases may well be your doom. Please, read the final letter i wrote regarding my almost unbreakable relationship with these cases. 
""
Me and Cases, We need time apart. 
It's for the best, we both agree. 
Not indefinitely, maybe one day, better versions of both of us will meet again.... 
I think we can both walk away happy. Its better than becoming enemies. 
Neither of us would want that.
I think its the best decision here, we were tearing each other apart, it was hard on both of us. 
We can both move on to better lives that we have ahead of us, meet new people and hell, maybe even get married? Who knows... who knows... 
All i know is that i am a happier man now, and i am sure that they is as well. 
We had good times. 
We had sad times. 
Remember that time Breakout? When i bought you, and you had that first, amazing butterfly knife in it? ahhh those were truly the days.... 
And do you remember Phoenix? that time when we found the karambit together? They were the good times, the times i wish we saved now... 
I got greedy, I cheated on you both with Vanguard, and Winter Offensive. I made mistakes yes, and i apologised. You welcomed me back, supposedly a changed man. Then, soon afterwards it became clear we needed time apart. I met Dota 2, a lovely girl but not quite what i was looking for, didnt quite have the thrilling feeling i had when i was around you guys... I had to get you back, but nothing was working... everytime i would take one of you out on a date you only brought with you the pain and suffering of the previous time together.. The memories, the pain... The USP-S's....... And you know what guys? I regret my actions... I really do, but its too late to dwell on the past. I should have been happy with you both. Two wonderful cases that i should have just kept and cherished forever. 
But both of us, we could not forget my treachery, my dishonesty. I was not lying to you Breakout, or you Phoenix, i was decieving myself, and for that, i only have myself to blame. We had good times, dont get me wrong, but this needs to end now, as all good things eventually do. I leave this relationship at a point i feel we can both be satisfied with. I take away my M4A4, and my lovely awp i will cherish forever, and i will always remember you guys when i kill with it. You also get to take away all of my money, which i am sure will be put to good use, like getting valve to update the servers (Kappa). 
Goodbye cases, what we had at one point, was truly Magical. :'( ""			"

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not your average FPS.
+Game Sense and Skill are very important when it comes to CSGO.
What to expect out of particular opponents and the most likely situations you'll be facing

If you wish to rack up kills, run and gun, and just barge into T spawn guns blazing with no plan,
this is not the game for you.

Someone running around with an M4 and shooting every teammate in the face with a shot to the head does not necessarily mean hacks. Players can always be better (and most of the time will be better) than you, so you need to learn to be better than them.
All in all, CSGO is one of the best games I have played.

Good:
+Gameplay mechanics
+Graphics are quiet good
+Feels little bit like Modern Warfare 2
+Camos
+Awesome maps
+EPIC comebacks from 14-1 to 14-14 in no time if you communicate
+Suka blyat is not, but karma is a ""bich"", so does KURVVA
Bad:
-Servers are unstable sometimes
-Radiculous BAN systems, if I get a BAN its automatically 7 days if someone else gets its simple as that only 30 minutes - ULTIMATE RAGE AFTER THAT

Counter-Strike Global Offensive is a fast paced, team-based first person shooter.
The Good
There's so much good things to say about this game! It just all works so well, the gunplay feels fluid and is unforgiving. If you don't have your aiming down, you are going to get owned. It takes some practise, but it isn't as impossible to get into as the previous Counter-Strike games.
This game is just so good, you'll have to buy it to experience it
The Bad

This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems.
HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[2] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[3] Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]			"

730,CukiMonsta,10,13,4,True,"1,035.2","March 28, 2015","I finally decided to write a proper review for CS:GO. So... I bought this game within a week of playing my first few games of Counter Strike: Source. I was not disappointed. I know it's a bit of a bore reading ♥♥♥♥ like this but if you're looking for an overall 'view' on CSGO, skip down to the bottom for my overall view.
Will you run it?
Chances are you'll be able to run it... It isn't exactly the most intensive game so you'll probably be able to run it smooth at a constant 60fps with anything built less than five years ago.
Community
The community is nice enough and often help you in the form of them raging at you through the mic. Okay... So, the community... Isn't the nicest. Before people rage at me... Not all of the community is so bad, just the minority that can be... Pardon my language... D********... Some people complain about the russians, some of them can be quite annoying... Thank god for the 'block communication' feature but not all scream '♥♥♥♥ blyat' down the mic.
Graphics
If you're looking for a super aesthetically pleasing-Planetside 2 ultra looking game then CS isn't for you... The graphics aren't bad but it's not going to win any prizes either. What I will say is that it's a large jump from Source... Where this game truly shines is in its gameplay.
Gameplay
The game is largely skill based, and from what I've played so far, requires a large amount of dedication to learn maps and how to use each of the weapons. If you're coming from COD-like shooters as I did you're going to need to be prepared to spend hours of practice in casual in order to learn spray patterns, smoke spots and other subtle hints which can make a massive difference in competitive play. There's a wide arsenal of weapons, ranging from extremely short range (the shotguns) to extremely long range (snipers). Unlike other shooters with a wide arsenal of weaponry, each weapons has its place and time. Eg, 3 different rifles for each team (excluding the snipers). The standard M4 and AK for a full buy but also the famas and galil for a force buy, aswell as the SG and AUG if you're a baller. $_$ One of THE most surprising features of the game was the extremely useful nature of the nades. You'll go into your first game buying 0 nades, yet after your 2nd game they'll be one of the most utilised items in your arsenal. No. I'm not talking about that frag that kills everyone within a 5m radius in any other game you've played. I'm talking about the flashes, moltovs and smokes, in fact, even the decoy has its place. You'll end your 2nd game hating the frag however. Sure, it's good taking 20hp off a coupla people holding B site in Dust 2 but you sure as hell aren't gonna get any kills with the ♥♥♥♥♥.  As I said earlier, the community does help sometimes, most often in competitive however.
Gamemodes
There's 5 official gamemodes:
Arms Race
Deathmatch
Demolition
Hostage
Bomb
All official gamemodes are teambased, emphasising the teamwork element of the competitive game modes yet some gamemodes do not at all rely on teamwork such as Deathmatch or Arms Race which is based mainly on your individual skill.
Arms Race
Here, you'll be in teams however, as a solo player, you'll be looking to reach the golden knife first. You get points for each weapon kill which will help in the advancement to the next weapon level.
Deathmatch
Here, you are also playing as teams however, the main objective is to end the game with the most points. I think it should be renamed 'AWPmatch' personally, considering over 60% of the players use it. I sometimes wonder why people even bother using custom AWP community servers.
Demolition
Here's a gamemode I have yet to build an opinion on, having played it very little. Each kill every new round lets you advance to the next weapon. So what happens if you get multiple kills in a round? I hear you ask. FRAGS! Well, for each extra kill, past the first I mean, you get an extra frag grenade. Eh, f*** my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ explanations, I'll give you an example. So, for example, you enter a round, get 3 kills and annihilate the enemy team. You'll advance to the next weapon due to your kill but also earn yourself 2 extra frags to use in the following round!
Bomb
So... I'm not sure about the official name of the gamemode but it's the gamemode most previous CS players will be extremely familiar with. There's Counter Terrorists and Terrorists. Counter Terrorists playing the defensive role for the main part of the round while Terrorists will be looking to head to one of the sites and plant the bomb. You start the round with $800 in pocket and looking to spend as efficiently as possible in order to win the pistol rounds which will leave you in good steed for the oncoming rounds. Each round starts with a counter of two minutes, which if the counter terrorists run down, will lend themselves a victory. Within this time period, the Terrorists will be looking to plant the bomb, shortening the round time down to 45seconds, which is the time taken for the bomb to explode. The Counter Terrorists then have to defuse within the time limit. The round is won by Counter Terrorists by either running down the clock, defusing the bomb, or eliminating all of the Terrorists. It is won by Terrorists by planting the bomb and it exploding, or by eliminating the Counter Terrorists. Each round win lends more money than a round loss however increasing streaks of round losses lends itself more money. HOWEVER if the Counter Terrorists (Or CTs) run down the clock and win the round, the terrorists will not earn any money for that round lost. Money is also earned by planting and defusing the bomb and for getting kills, with a knife kill yielding the most of $1500 (on the enemy team of course). A teamkill however leads to a loss of money which can be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ unless you're a baller with $16k.
Hostage
Largely the same game mechanics as the previous game mode so I won't go back through it all but with an extreme role reversal, with CTs playing an offensive role and Terrorists (CT) playing a defensive role. The CTs objective is to get the hostages back to their spawn point while the TTs have to defend and either run down the clock or eliminate the CTs.
Sounds
The weapon sounds aren't accurate in the slightest but do however sound pleasing and distinctive which can help in competitive play. Sneaky beaky like... The first time I heard that I lolled<--Nuff said...
Miscellaneous
Skins
Skins are dropped randomly after every game. These are for the majority, ♥♥♥♥ 'common' £0.03 skins and I even find that they often look worse than the default colours. You can also get skins from cases but most aren't very good and are worth a whole lot of ♥♥♥♥ compared to the ~$2 you payed for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, motherf****** key. Some skins do look real nice though and I've heard also give extra damage bonuses and s***. ;)
Skill levels
As of the new update, a ranking system was implemented. You get xp for your games which increases your level. Each new rank for each new week will grant you a skin. Mind you, they are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unless you have the new pass.
Ranks
So... No one actually knows how this mysterious system works but that it's based on an ELO system. Each win supposedly increases your ELO while a loss decreases it. Number of MVPs also supposedly increases it. This is factored into matchmaking but is abused by the Smurfs that plague the game.
Overall
A word of warning... This game isn't fun... It's repetitive, boring, really fustrating but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ f****** addictive... If you're looking for a game that's fun I'd suggest COD but it doesn't have the same... 'feel' as CS and not near enough rewarding when you get a kill. 
Overall I'd give it a solid 9/10 just down to the fact that some of the community isn't the nicest at the best of times...			"

As a fan of the genre this game feels like a revitalized classic with some great improvements and additions borrowed from other Valve games. After more than a decade of the same FPS Dust 2 action, the weapon cases, skins, and community maps included via the Workshop pump new life into the genre and bring me back to the heyday of Counter-Strike beta, before Steam even existed... but with a whole lot more value. I won't touch on any negative aspects because I could nitpick and complain about small things that really don't impact the experience.
Overall it's a fun game with some modern functionality that adds to the play style. If you were ever a fan of the original games through Counter-Strike: Source, you should definitely check this out.			"

The casual mode is, while fun most of the time, a bit lacking in meaning to any halfway serious gamer. The competitive (classic ranked matchmaking) mode is extremely competitive, with most players simply looking to rank up at any cost, or simply not rank down at worst. Hackers and smurfers run fairly rampant in competitive, and can be a large deterrent to serous legit players. The game is updated fairly often, with new operation map packs available perhaps twice a year, carrying with them the added excitement of new skins for weapons in the game.
Overall the game is a blast, whether you just enjoy FPS's to shoot things, or create an elite team capable of conquering the world.			"

A risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving. I'd caution new players to the Call of Strike: Global Warfare series, as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience. However, if you can get over that curvature with ease, the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter.

730,raptordaking,14,21,4,True,"3,604.0","October 3, 2014","Great true Counter-Strike-like competitive feeling in this latest addition to CS games. It has most of the elements from the older CS games (1.6 and Source) but with updated visuals, weapon skins and stickers, matchmaking system and a goal to unite the two different Counter-Strike communitites: CS1.6 and CSS. This game does that pretty well having a lot of the good old content but still a lot of new stuff to discover.
+
+ Easy to use Matchmaking system.
+ Updated content (some new weapons that were not in CS1.6 or CSS and new versions of all the classic maps)
+ Overwatch is a great way to get the community involved in banning cheaters but it's not perfect system (not at all) A lot of important information about the match is not available for overwatchers and in order to get ow you need to win 150 matchmaking games and have a rank at atleast Gold Nova 1. Players on that level are usually not good enough to judge is someone is cheating or not and some more suspicious cases may get more votes on ""Evidence beyond reasonable doubt"" even when no cheating is involved.
+ Skins and stickers. These things keep a lot more casual players playing the game and gives the more competitive ones new and exiting content in the game after playing the game for thousands of hours.
+ Operations that make people play the new maps and all the available official gamemodes makes the game to have more content (operations are usually pretty cheap ~5€ containing usually 5 or more maps that can be played on Valves official servers and some kind of scoreboard that keeps track of your matchmaking stats like kills, headshot % and matches won)
+ Big professional tournamets mainly funded by the community. You buy a certain key to open a weapon case (Esport key in this case is the one that supports electronic sports) and a portion of the money goes towards these tournamets. These big events gather a lot of Counter-Strike people together watching the games and having some great entertainment. When the professional scene does well the game itself attracts more people playing it.
+ Game gets updated really often compared to many other multiplayer shooters. Sometimes there can be updates every week some of them being quite major. Valve even listens to the community sometimes to make the game even better and more enjoyable. (Obviously they want to hear what the pros have to say about the current state of the game)
-
- Lots of hackers playing in the higher rankings in matchmaking. As Valve killed boosting in its known form most cheaters are just the one who want get to those highest ranks. Still some boosting appears to be seen even tho it doesn't work like that anymore.
- Matchmaking system is quite broken. Rankings don't show the true skill and ability to play as a team but it still serves the purpose. MM being 64 tick is the main problem or atleast thats what the community says when it comes to the system itself. Most players would still pick hackers over low tickrate if it was about matchmaking as whole. The problem around this is that to be able to get any advantage of 128 tick your game needs to run at atleast that 128 fps (not exatly but close to it) and according to Valve greatly over half of the players have an average fps of 30 or less. Thats not enough to get any advantage of high tickrate servers. Another proble with matchmaking is that sometimes it puts higher ranks against lower ones which is not equal at all and usually results in a slaughter of either side. Balance just sometimes isn't there.
- Bad behaviour among many players makes some matchmaking games really feel like you'd like to punch somebody. People that refuse to use teamwork or communicate are even worse than bad behaving ones when you want/need to win games.
- Valve has a weird way of updating something (like buffing a weapon) without any testing if it will actually work like it was supposed to. This has lead to CZ-75, AUG buff, the insane Tec-9 buff and a lot more weird but sometimes even funny updates. Still a little bit of testing on the field wouldn't hurt anyone.
All in all I would totally recommend this game for everyone! Even if it may seem difficult at first you can only get better by learning and playing. For me it has been quite 4.5/5 experience so far so if you have the will give it a go!			"

730,linkap,6,6,0,True,817.0,"March 9, 2014","Gameplay:
This game much like, but also more so than the other Counter-Strike series is very competitive and even has its own game mode for such a style of gameplay. It's noticeably more competitive due to its live streams on Twitch and hosted events, this means that this games requires you to be more aware of your surroundings, being a better team player and good team leader. At times it requires to be a lone wolf and get new common self-awards such as a 'clutch' or an 'ace' AKA finishing off the opposing team as the last man standing. Compared to games like Call of Duty which I consider very fast paced, this game takes things slow and even with a 2 minute time limit you are required to take precautions before moving in.
Graphics:
Although I'm not bothered about graphics and doesn't really play a major factor in my decisions of getting games, these graphics have definitely improved from the previous Valve engine and still have that Counter-Strike feel. Some maps of course are imported from previous Counter-Strike games, and therefore have that similar but still fresh look, however the new maps have a definite sense of improvement and renewed style.
Controls & Movement:
The controls to this game are exactly the same to the other Counter-Strike series and therefore has it's playability output increased however, for those new to the game and have played previous game such as Call of Duty and Battlefield etc, getting used to this may prove difficult to some. The controls to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are quite simple but getting used to the way the mechanics move may take a small amount of time. That's the good thing about Counter-Strike though, it's a reasonably easy game to get into but difficult to master, although with help from community workshop maps that help improve accuracy, you'll be able to have a small advantage.
Conclusion:
Overall this game is fantastic, bringing a classic FPS to a new generation of games. This games requires skill and isn't all about shooting first and thinking after, especially in competitive situations. Playing with friends is easily still really fun and has a user-friendly interface. Even though there's the addition of buying weapon skins etc, I find that's a bonus to the game if you're really committed. I think that, this is a game where you can endlessly rack countless hours up and be none the wiser.

I just love how this game is designed from it's looks to its sounds, I have never heard any sounds like this having alot of bass in them. Sound is your best friend unless you want to get shot in the back of the head with an AK-47. And yet I thought this game couldn't get any better but Valve is still putting out updates for it including skins for your weapons to add that little extra dazzle to them while you deal some heavy damage to those damn terrorists. It also includes a competitive mode and ranking system if you ever want to play a serious game, but beware, most of these people in competitives aren't very nice no matter what you do, however, you may run into a few polite ones along your journey.
And even better! When you shoot a chicken they EXPLODE. They also like to dress up into ghosts and reindeers in holiday events!
If you ever have a spare $15 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PICK UP THIS GAME! Plus you can get some extra money from selling those skins for a few dollars ;D. Now please hurry the frick up and BUY THIS GAME 20/10!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well now i'm back to this review and oh god can I even begin to tell you how many updates they have put out since I have posted this? They now have a workshop in which you can make you're own camo's/skins to be picked by Valve to be put into this awesome masterpiece (Although, it is a bit complicating).
This game is probably the most realistic game out there (next to Insurgency). It's nothing like ♥♥♥♥ing COD where all you have is 10 year old trollers. You actually find people who are willing to help out AS A TEAM. Now I know i'm rambling, but stick with me, i'm gonna put pro's and cons in.
Pros:-
Quite realistic
Can make some extra money
Long lasting gameplay
Competitive gamemode (ranked)
Demolition
An awesome arrange of guns
Constantly gets updated.
Cons:-
People aren't always the nicest.
Griefers.

730,drastic977,6,6,0,True,584.8,"December 27, 2014","Counter Strike: Global Offensive is unlike any other FPS in it's genre with it's old school CS1.6-ish gun mechanics and similar maps from it's predecessor games. You play the role of a terrorist, whose job is to get to a bomb site, plant the bomb there and wait for it to detonate or kill every Counter-Terrorist preventing you from planting that bomb site. On the other hand, you play as a Counter-Terrorist whose job is to prevent the bomb from being planted at any of the bomb sites either by elimination of the aforementioned terrorists or by defusal of the bomb. The game may be viewed as one that has gun mechanics of its own, completely unique from what one may be used to in most FPS games and that it takes a little getting used to the whole game before one can start getting kills. That, and it's all about reaction times, camping the right spots, watching out for your buddies and what not. One minute you're winning and the next thing you know, your buddies have been killed by a flanking SMG bearer. In addition, the game's competitive mode and its integration with the skill system is what makes it and breaks it. The skill system determines your skill and puts you up against players of the same skill level so to ensure a fun user experience however, this very feature is what sometimes breaks it. How? People who buy dual accounts just to play with new players. That's how. 
All in all, the game's cost is perfectly balanced and no pay2win aspect influences the game in any way. All items that can be bought with money are purely cosmetic. Thumbs up, indeed!			"

Pros:
   • You acquire pennies in the form of random drops!
   • You get to be mad... with friends!
   • You become culturally enriched!
   • You recognize your online breaking point!
   • You learn teamwork... off of the other team!
Cons:
   • Better connection means better player.
   • Luck is a big factor for a low/mid skilled player.
   • Hit detection; 60% of the time it works every time
   • Hacking happens more than people admit less than people assume
   • More smurfs than Gargamel knows what to do with
Conclusion:
All in all it's a fun game and even more so with friends. The worst part of it being the community to which there is no real escape. If it isn't a person trolling or being a pain in your retinas it's a person who is light years ahead of you in skill, but has a fresh account waiting to ruin your experience. The skill gap is more of a chasm leaving for a compilation of infuriating gameplay and a mountain of progression you can find yourself climbing up or falling down. The online play is more connection warfare than any other FPS I've played meaning players with a bad connection have a strong probability of being held back severely. The dedicated servers provided don't help the cause either; numerous professional players and full time CSGO streamers claim the hit detection simply doesn't cut it. Even through all this there is good. 
By far the best part about this game is the enjoyment you get out of playing it with a few other friends. You can share your victories, your laughs, your tactics, and yes your anger with people you know and people you enjoy. So even if you aren't enjoying the match you are still enjoying something.
Recommendation:
If you enjoy First Person Shooters and haven't picked this up yet there is no reason not to give it a try. It's one of the most popular and populated FPS on the market today and will continue to dominate in that respect. Whether you should continue to play after you have tried it is completely up to you. This game has a way of killing the fish it hooks.			"

Now something serious tho,
There is no support from other players whatsoever,
for example when you join a competative match there is no one who helps out a new player, all they can say is ""suka"" blyat and any other russian/slavic language lel. 
And when you're last alive ofcourse, your whole team judges every move you make. and when you get into a 1v5 clutch situation you get rekt from behind..
Don't forget the votekick system, they don't like newbies. So prepare to get kicked within 1.5 seconds on a competative match, I do recommend it but pls go play 200 casual b4 you join any competative match,

This is how they acctually work:
- Silver I - You have to actually TRY to be this bad.
- Silver II - If flashed: panic and throw all your nades! 
- Silver III - My prayers go out to you
- Silver IV - This is where insanity begins
- Silver Elite - Same as below but worse.
- Silver Elite Master - Generally a bad player. This is where most people who are new to CS but not FPS show up.
Welcome to Gold Nova! You are the best right? You made it out of Silver Hell!
- Gold Nova I 
  - And Gold Nova II - Still in the awkward process of learning to aim correctly.
- Gold Nova III - Still trying to learn the maps; and the smokes for those maps.
-Gold Nova Master - A bit below average, but very close to not being a noob.
- Master Guardian I 
 - And Master Guardian II - KING OF NOOBS - The average CS player.
- Master Guardian Elite -  Just a tad above average; but nothing special.
- Distinguished Master Guardian - E-L-O H-E-L-L
- Legendary Eagle - The average rank for a good player. And a few lucky DMGs.
- Legendary Eagle Master - The land where all the hackers end up after their 10 placement wins.
- Supreme Master First Class - Good enough to ♥♥♥♥ on all the other ranks, but not lucky enough to NOT get that one silver elite on your team.
- The Global Elite - Congrats; you make up the 0.5% of the CSGO community. So you are the best, at 1 of 2 things:
1. Actually being good at CSGO 
Or
2. Really good at hiding hacks long enough to get this far...

730,76561197967589917,6,6,0,True,"1,872.4","June 4, 2014","Where to start... CS is very diverse in the array of gametypes it provides, in the people that play it, and in the communities those people have created.  Communities and creative individuals of those communities have invented a wide vareity of very innovative gametypes. Different gametypes, from any other game, like surfing; where each player must slide down large slopes to gather momentum to launch themselves over large gaps in the slopes - if you don't have enough speed; you fall, die and restart.  The speed and intense feeling of gaining that momentum is an entirely amazing concept alone.  There's also Jailbreak; where the Terrorists are in jail cells and the Counter-Terrorists are the jail security guards and one Counter-Terrorist is picked as the warden.  The warden will use their voice to issue commands to the Terrorists in specifically-made maps that contain minigames like a jumping obstacle course, bomb dodging arena, surfing course, and in one map I even saw a skeet-shooting arena where the skeet were the Terrorists hahahaha. If the terrorists are found betraying what the warden says the security team has rights to terminte that inmate which makes for an amazing level of deception as a Terrorist and a sense of mystery and hunting as a jail security guard.  These clever vareity of gametypes are only the tip of the iceberg as there are many servers with mods such as Warcraft; where players gain EXP to purchase skills and upgrades that give abilities such as a grapeling hook, a power jump, or temporary invisibility.  
While all the different gametypes are perfect for casual time spent playing and socializing with the hundreds of thousands of players constantly playing this game; i've yet to mention the competitive side which is by far the stake-in-the-ground of CS's long-lasting playability.  The professional scene, while it IS great, is not my primary description of 'competitive side'; the competitive side is more the general philosophy that, if a player is willing, they can nearly ALWAYS improve upon themselves.  There are fundamentals in this game that once learned you can build upon by yourself, with friends, or with an entire community to create quality and constructive gameplay for thousands of hours.  This philosophy alone is the groundwork for the seemingly endless vareity of topics any player can choose to constructively upon build their skills. 
Here are a few examples of different things in the game that contribute to its learnability:
Game-sense: The sense you get when you don't see an enemy and you can determine where they are based on where they are not.  Game-sense also runs deep with the strategic and competitive de_, or Demolition, style gametypes which are round-based (meaning when you die you're dead until the end of the round).  In demolition there are 2 bombsites that the Terrorists have to choose from, and the CTs must guard both until they get a feeling of which bomb site the Ts have chosen.  Once they depict which way the Ts are heading the CTs must 'rotate', or re-route their attention, through the map to the other bombsite.  This 'rotation' creates predictable motions from either team and you can learn to expect certain actions and invent creative ways to approach the bomb sites.  This style of gameplay greatly contributes to the total capacity of the game-sense CS instills.
Gun spray control: Unlike most shooters each gun in CS has a ""pattern"" that a spray of bullets from each gun has.  Most shooters have an algorithim that seemingly randomizes sprays but CS has a LEARNABLE and CONTROLLABLE spray.  There are many other variables such as movement speed, crouched status, and spray speed that factor into it but overall spray patterns are discoverable through experience and experimentation which can greatly contribute to how powerful the weapons can seem at different levels of awareness of these variables.
Map strategy: CS has a wide vareity of maps.  In some, close-quarter and in-the-moment reaction is needed and in others much more planning and teamwork is required to prevail.  Also some maps, as mentioned, are game-type specific so depending on what you're looking for out of CS you can browse community servers to find it or que up in competitive matchmaking and only play the maps you want.There are also many tricks in each map such as jumps, grenade bounces, houses or buildings you can throw grenades over to position them strategically.  
All of these aspects greatly contribute to the philosophy of self-growth and trying to make yourself a better player regardless of what people you play with, what gametype you play, or if you even decide play competitive matchmaking.  Its all up to you and this game can provide you that great sense of progression and growth that I've not found in a video game in a long, long time.			"

I was only 12 years old.
I loved CS:GO so much.
I had all the rare skins.
I pray to Gaben every night, hoping I would unbox a knife some day.
""Gaben is love,"" I said. ""Gaben is life.""
My dad overhears me and calls me a hacker.
I know he's just jealous that I got recruited into FaZe clan.
I call him a hardscoper.
My dad no scopes me and sends me to my room.
As I feel my numb face, I turn on my PC and log into Steam.
My hands are shivering as I click on the ""PLAY"" button to open up CS:GO
""I'll show that hardscoper,"" I said.
I open up the Steam Market Place, and purchase 20 Half Life 3 Cases and Keys.
10 minutes have passed by, and I've unboxed 19 Battle-Scarred Negev l Desert Strikes.
As I move my cursor over to the final case, I click and select ""OPEN"".
My cursor moves even slower as I move it towards the giant, green ""USE KEY"" button.
I click the button.
As I see all of these weapons fly by, the scroll finally starts slowing down.
""I can't look,"" I said to myself. ""My dad will noscope me when he see's that I've spent six grand on super exclusive and rare Half Life 3 Cases and Keys.
I close my eyes and listen as I hear Gaben laughing over me, as if I am almost certain that I did not get a knife. 
I open my eyes. 
A large clump of feces leaves my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ very quick, as my eyes look at the item I have just been given by the Holy Gaben himself.
Another clump starts sliding out as I stand up to run to my dad to tell him that I've just unboxed a StatTrak Factory New Karambit Fade.
My dad cries as he suddenly gets his Steam account hacked by OpTic.
I pull out my new knife and quickscope his face.
I then walk into my room, take my pants off, and thrust my pelvic region into the air, imagining Gaben with me.

Requires tactics and knowing the right time to do certain things. Many things come into play like recoil or accuracy when moving. Would reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a shooting game but a tad more slow-paced and more tactical. If you want just a quick game you can do a casual or deathmatch. The competitive scene for this game is great and really expresses the tactics and teamwork of this game. Without that your just a bunch of idiots with guns!

The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever. Recommended to all competitive and also casual players !

730,YanzoS,6,6,2,True,"1,029.5","April 29, 2015","Valve, I salute you. This is an incredible game based off incredible games, with it's updated graphics, the game looks alot better. Old school gameplay but with huge mod support. Players can make any map and put it into the game. Players can make skins and put these into the game, Valve may even pay you to do this.
Aside from the standard gameplay (mostly bomb defuse), which is actually quite realistic considering the intensive recoil on every gun, the game brings a huge economy on just simply skins through buying keys on dropped crates throughout the maps inside the game.
CS GO has been growing enormously and it will continue to grow, especially because of E-sports, the betting on teams, the 'skins' economy and a huge growing community. 
Valve also updates the game regularly. ('cough' Tec-9 nerf 'cough')
Greatly recommended to anyone wanting to play a serious shooter with a rather steep learning curve.
Although like every other competitive game, new players are going to  have a rather hard time.
Ranked games has A LOT of smurfs, especially on lower ranks, which hurts many of the new players.
Also even with Valve trying to VACban every hacker, there still seems to be quite a few in the game, especially at higher ranks (Above Distuingished Master Guardian)
If you like shooters, buy it, play it, love it. Just don't jump into ranked until you've gotten down the heavy recoil, some basic map knowledge and anger management. Especially the last one, trust me on that.
Plusses:
+ If you've always wanted to learn Russian, now is your chance.
+ Recoil system
+ Lots of maps
+ Mod support
+ Custom servers
+ Huge in E-sports
+ CS:GO has its own economy with skins
+ Did I say skins already ?
+ Overwatch system
+ Decent amount of weaponry
+ Gambling (both sides)
+ Dedicated servers
+ Huge amount of services throughout other sites with their own servers (ESEA, FACEit etc.)
+ Surfing
Minusses:
- Russians
- Hackers
- Smurfcity
- Toxic players (If u are new and bad, do NOT play ranked yet)
- Gambling (both sides)
- Gameplay can get repetitive
The plusses outweight the minusses, get the game ! The pricing isn't high at all, so definitely give it a try.			"

730,SuccessBreedsJealousy,6,6,6,True,786.8,"August 21, 2015","There are two ways to review Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
The easy Silver way, and the hard any other rank way. First off, I'll start with the Silver way.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a good, low cost game, that is often featured at the top of Steam's top seller list. However, be aware, the price that you are paying when you initially hit the purchase button is not the games true price. You will spend more on this game. Just like when the Counter Terrorists face the Terrorists - this is not a time for negotiation. Get your/your mums credit card ready, because it's going to be used. 
 The first thing I bought was a single key. I got a case drop from my first game, and I thought that the £1.49 investment would be meaningless. I was wrong.
 I was lucky enough to get an M4A4 Howl, in the ""Minimal Wear"" condition. Pretty lucky, when you consider that the current price for it is around £250. It wasn't at the time, it was 10 times less. I still sold it, and invested in more keys. Before playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive I had no idea what it was like to be a compulsive gambler. I do now.
This isn't the end though. Before I played this game, I enjoyed speaking to people of different cultures, and nationalities. Now, however, I have a burning rage inside me whenever I discover that somebody is from Russia. I'm just glad I finished my A Level in Russian history before I started playing this game. The Polish are a sort of wildcard - some of them you love; they are friendly, helpful, just like your local plumber. Some of them though... You know that they are down the job centre whittling away your paycheck by claiming benefits, then using the computers there to log some hours in CS:GO, to push through smokes, and to buy an AWP in an eco round. You know you shouldn't hate them - everybody makes mistakes, but you are in a blind rage.
You need to win. You need to get out of the Silver ranks. You are now in too deep - you are in the ""other ranks"" stage. You feel you need to prove that you are better than everybody else. First the silvers, you criticise every mistake they make. Even if they aren't Silver... they are now. You rise up the ranks - Gold Nova I, II, then III... you get so close to Gold Nova Master... that fourth star... but before you know it, you slip. You're falling down the ladder... you don't know why. 
People believe that Match Making is a pit. It is not a pit, it is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never try to climb again. The fall breaks them. Some who are given the chance to climb high refuse - they cling to their rungs, their Master Guardian IIs or their Legendary Eagles. They are content with not believing they can go higher.
Only the ladder is real, and the climb is all there is.
Be warned, once you start climbing, you must keep looking forwards. On the way, you will learn much about yourself - that you have an innate ability to shout curses in foreign tongues, and that you can go weeks without eating as long as it means putting another hard earned sterling towards getting that god damn Asiimov. You will doubt the ability of all those around you, just as they will doubt you. Some days will be good, some bad. Some are easy, but many are hard. You will cry, but you will enjoy every moment of it.
You will make friends and enemies on the way. Children, boys, girls, men, women. Some you will love, many you will like, and even more you will hate. Often you will close your game hoping to ravage a beautiful Norwegian girl, other days you will want to take up arms and burn down entire Eastern European nations. There will be plenty of salt on the way, and it will be used for many different things. You will bury it into the earth, so Russia can no longer sustain life, freeing up valuable space in the EU servers. Often, you will become the salt, as you can no longer hold in your anger - yet you must realise the truth. It was your fault. It was your lack of skill, or your poor reaction time. You're just having a bad day. Many will not admit this, and seek to blame others - on this day, they are the salt. 
Once you begin, as I have mentioned many times, there is no stopping. Many people believe that there are many ""Counter-Strike clones"". There is actually only one. Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike 1.6 are nothing like Global Offensive. The only game that comes anywhere close to representing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, in contrary to popular believe, Katamari Damacy. This is because only Katamari Damacy represents Global Offensive on a wider scale - a ball that gains momentum, and keeps growing. You cannot stop the growth. You can't stop, for the ball has grown too large. You reach a point where you are unable to stop your balls from stealing your money, and sending it to a small country thousands of miles away. Your balls give you hatred towards minorities, and towards people who are of not only a lesser skill level than you, but a greater one. Your balls keep growing... until you get to the top.
When you reach the top, you will look back and question yourself. Was it worth it? Should I have alienated my friends? What do I do now? What is that smell? When did I last feed my cat? Where should I bury him? Is it too late to get the game refunded? 
Or, the most important question of all...

It is guaranteed that at the very least, 60% of your time spent playing this game will be comprised of spectating your 14 year old Russian non-English speaking teammates continually fling themselves into an Auto-Rifle oblivion barrage and blame you in their foul Slavic tongues for their resulting deaths.

730,Royalcrown28,6,6,0,False,401.5,"January 27, 2015","well, i had 2 kids in my game trolling a sure win bc i picked up an awp. So the rest of the game they did nothing but try to stand in front of teammates so that they would accidently team kill, my brother left the game and got a 1 week ban, i stayed and played, accidently killed the kid that kept jumping in front of me, got a 2 week ban. my roommate was in the game with us and not wanting a ban, just sat at spawn... and he got afk auto kicked and has a 2 day ban. All 3 of us got bans while the 2 people that actually needed the ban got off scott free. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. TOXIC community ZERO EFFORT from the devs to fix the JUSTICE SYSTEM in place that BANS INNOCENT PLAYERS trying to play the game the proper way while PROTECTING GRIEFERS.			"

Jeder gamer dem counter strike nicht gelÃ¤ufig ist sollte sich wohl lieber seines computers entledigen und lieber brettspiele spielen.
Von daher kann man nur sagen das die grafik erheblich verbessert wurde (siehe screenshot(s)).
AuÃŸerdem bietet es 22 verschiedene waffen und viel abwechslungen bei der map-wahl.			"
