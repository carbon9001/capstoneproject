I only did missions for the sake of progress and to get new stuff. I never cared really. Not the case with 5 at all. I haven't come across a single thing that I can point at and say &quot;that's not good&quot;. The depth and attention to detail with every single thing is incredible. The character switching really keeps the singleplayer fresh too. Every feature/facet/minigame feels equally or more detailed than games that focus on those specific things alone.                   </div>
